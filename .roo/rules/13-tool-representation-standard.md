# Standard: Tool Representation in Documentation and Discussion

**Objective:** To ensure clarity, improve readability, and enhance safety by standardizing how tool usage is represented when it is being discussed or documented, as opposed to being executed.

**Applies To:** All modes when creating or modifying documentation (rules, KBs, ADRs, process descriptions, etc.), analyzing logs, or engaging in meta-discussions about tool usage within chat.

**Guideline:**

1.  **Standard Representation (for Discussion/Documentation):**
    *   When referring to the use of a tool within documentation or during discussions (where execution is *not* the immediate intent), **MUST** use descriptive natural language.
    *   Clearly state the action and the tool name, typically using backticks for the tool name.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   "The mode should then use the `read_file` tool to get the content."
        *   "Consider calling `apply_diff` with the necessary changes."
        *   "This workflow involves using `execute_command` to run the build script."
        *   "Analysis showed the `search_files` tool was used with pattern 'xyz'."

2.  **Execution Syntax Reservation:**
    *   The full XML syntax is for the single instance where the mode intends for the tool to be executed by the system in the immediate next step.

3.  **Rationale:**
    *   **Clarity:** Descriptive text makes the intent clear â€“ discussing or documenting the *idea* of using a tool, rather than triggering its execution.
    *   **Safety:** Prevents accidental tool execution if documentation or chat logs containing XML syntax are misinterpreted by the system or other modes.
    *   **Readability:** Natural language descriptions are generally easier for humans and AI to read and understand within the flow of documentation or discussion.
    *   **Consistency:** Provides a workspace-wide standard for representing tool usage in non-execution contexts.

4.  **Tool Awareness:** Modes receive the list of currently available tools and their required syntax within their operational context. This rule governs how to *refer* to those tools when not directly invoking them for execution.

By following this guideline, we maintain a clear distinction between executing a tool and discussing its use, contributing to a safer and more understandable development environment.

# Session Interaction Enhancements & Intent Recognition

## 1. Introduction

This whitepaper outlines proposed enhancements to session management within Roo Commander. The primary purpose is to improve the user experience by providing more intuitive and powerful ways to manage interaction sessions.

Enhanced session management offers several key benefits:

*   **Improved Continuity:** Seamlessly pause and resume work across different times or even different objectives, carrying relevant context forward.
*   **Efficient Handoffs:** Facilitate smoother transitions if work needs to be picked up by another user or a different instance of Roo Commander by providing clear session summaries.
*   **Better Context Management:** Allow users to explicitly control session boundaries and leverage summarized context from previous sessions, reducing cognitive load and improving the relevance of Roo Commander's assistance.
*   **Enhanced Traceability:** More structured session interactions improve the audit trail of activities and decisions.

## 2. Current Session Management (Brief Overview)

Roo Commander currently implements session management based on `RULE-SESSION-MGMT-STANDARD-V7`. This system utilizes:

*   A **Session Log (`session_log.md`)**: A TOML+Markdown file located in a dedicated session directory (e.g., `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-[Goal]-[Timestamp]/session_log.md`). This log captures key events, decisions, and metadata related to a user's interaction.
*   An **Artifact Structure**: Within each session directory, an `artifacts/` subdirectory houses contextual notes, documents, code snippets, and other relevant files generated or referenced during the session, organized into standard subdirectories (e.g., `notes/`, `learnings/`, `summaries/`) as per `.ruru/docs/standards/session_artifact_guidelines_v1.md`.

While robust, the current system primarily relies on coordinator modes to initiate and manage sessions, often implicitly. The proposed enhancements aim to give users more direct control and leverage intent recognition for smoother interactions.

## 3. Proposed `!sessions` Command (or similar trigger)

To provide users with explicit control over session management, we propose introducing a command or trigger mechanism.

**Potential Triggers:**

*   Explicit command: `!sessions`
*   Question-like trigger: `sessions?`
*   Natural language: User typing "sessions", "manage sessions", "session options".

Upon activation, Roo Commander would present a menu of options.

**Menu Options and Workflows:**

*   **Start New Session:**
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User selects "Start New Session".
        2.  Roo Commander (or `prime-coordinator`) prompts the user for a session goal/title (e.g., "What is the primary goal for this new session?").
        3.  Upon receiving the goal, Roo Commander initiates the new session creation process as defined in `RULE-SESSION-MGMT-STANDARD-V7`. This involves:
            *   Generating a unique `RooComSessionID`.
            *   Creating the session directory (e.g., `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-[SanitizedGoal]-[Timestamp]/`).
            *   Creating the `artifacts/` subdirectory and its standard internal structure (including `README.md` files for each artifact type, potentially by copying from `.ruru/templates/session_artifact_scaffold/`).
            *   Creating the `session_log.md` file using the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/19_mdtm_session.md` template, populating initial metadata (ID, title, status="🟢 Active", start_time, coordinator).
        4.  This creation process might be delegated by the coordinator mode to a specialist like `prime-txt` or a dedicated session setup agent for efficiency.
        5.  The new session becomes the active session.

*   **Resume Session:**
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User selects "Resume Session".
        2.  Roo Commander lists recent or currently "🟢 Active" / "⏸️ Paused" sessions. This list can be populated by scanning the `.ruru/sessions/` directory and parsing the `status` and `title` from each `session_log.md`.
        3.  User selects a `RooComSessionID` from the list.
        4.  Roo Commander loads the context of the selected session. This means:
            *   The selected `RooComSessionID` becomes the active session ID.
            *   The `session_log.md` for this session is loaded for continued logging.
            *   Key artifacts from its `artifacts/` directory (e.g., recent notes, a previous summary) might be proactively loaded into context or made easily accessible.
            *   The session status in `session_log.md` is updated to "🟢 Active" if it was "⏸️ Paused".

*   **Summarize Session:**
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User selects "Summarize Session".
        2.  Roo Commander prompts the user to specify which session to summarize:
            *   Option 1: The current active session.
            *   Option 2: Select from a list of past sessions (similar to "Resume Session" listing).
        3.  Once a session is chosen, Roo Commander delegates the summarization task to a specialist mode like `agent-session-summarizer`.
        4.  The `agent-session-summarizer` reads the chosen session's `session_log.md` and its `related_artifacts`.
        5.  A summary is generated using the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/50_session_summary.md` template.
        6.  The generated summary file is saved to the *original session's* artifact directory, specifically within a `summaries/` subdirectory: `.ruru/sessions/[OriginalSessionID]/artifacts/summaries/SESSUM-[OriginalSessionID]-[Timestamp].md`.
        7.  Roo Commander reports the full path of the created summary file to the user.

*   **Extend from Summary / Start New Session with Summary Context:**
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User selects "Extend from Summary" or "Start New from Summary".
        2.  Roo Commander prompts the user to select one or more existing session summary files. This could involve listing all files matching `.ruru/sessions/*/artifacts/summaries/SESSUM-*.md`.
        3.  User selects the desired summary file(s).
        4.  A **new session is initiated** following the "Start New Session" workflow (user is prompted for a new goal, new session directory and log are created).
        5.  The paths to the selected summary file(s) are linked in the new `session_log.md`'s TOML frontmatter. This could be via the existing `related_artifacts` array or a new dedicated field like `source_summaries: ["path/to/summary1.md", "path/to/summary2.md"]`.
    *   **Context Loading:**
        *   The content of these source summaries would need to be actively loaded or made readily available as foundational context for the new session. This could involve:
            *   Automatically pre-loading the summary content into the new session's initial context.
            *   Adding them as high-priority items in the new session's `session_log.md` or as initial "context" artifacts.
            *   The coordinator mode ensuring these summaries are part of the initial briefing for any tasks within the new session.

## 4. Intent-Driven Session Actions

Beyond explicit commands, Roo Commander could enhance user experience by recognizing natural language cues related to session state changes.

**Example Phrases and Corresponding Actions:**

*   **User:** "Let's pause for now," "I need to step away," "Pause session."
    *   **Roo Commander (Action):**
        1.  Confirm intent: "Okay, you'd like to pause the current session. Is that correct?" (using `ask_followup_question`).
        2.  If confirmed, update the active `session_log.md`: set `status` to `"⏸️ Paused"` and record `end_time`.
        3.  Inform user: "Session paused."

*   **User:** "We can pick this up tomorrow," "Let's continue this later," "Work on this tomorrow."
    *   **Roo Commander (Action):**
        1.  Confirm intent: "Got it. You'd like to pause and resume this work later. Would you like me to summarize the current session first to make it easier to pick up?" (using `ask_followup_question`).
        2.  If summarization is requested (or by default): Initiate the "Summarize Session" workflow for the current active session.
        3.  After summarization (if any), update the active `session_log.md`: set `status` to `"⏸️ Paused"` and record `end_time`.
        4.  Inform user: "Session summarized (if applicable) and paused. Ready when you are."

*   **User:** "Let's wrap this up," "We're done with this," "Complete session."
    *   **Roo Commander (Action):**
        1.  Confirm intent: "Alright, you'd like to complete and close the current session. Shall I generate a final summary?" (using `ask_followup_question`).
        2.  If summarization is requested (or a briefer "completion note" is generated): Initiate the "Summarize Session" workflow or a simplified version.
        3.  Update the active `session_log.md`: set `status` to `"🏁 Completed"` and record `end_time`.
        4.  Inform user: "Session completed and logged. Great work!"

**Confirmation is Key:** For all intent-driven actions, Roo Commander **MUST** confirm the inferred intent with the user before executing the session state change or related workflows (e.g., summarization). This prevents misunderstandings and ensures user control. The `ask_followup_question` tool is suitable for this.

## 5. Benefits of Enhanced Session Interactions

*   **Increased User Control:** Users gain explicit and intuitive ways to manage their interaction flows.
*   **Reduced Friction:** Natural language intent recognition can make session management feel more organic.
*   **Improved Context Preservation:** Summaries and the ability to extend from them ensure valuable context is not lost between sessions or when shifting focus.
*   **Streamlined Workflows:** Automating summarization and linking related sessions can save user time and effort.
*   **Better Long-Term Memory:** A well-organized archive of sessions, complete with summaries, serves as a valuable knowledge base.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Summarized sessions can be more easily shared or handed off.

## 6. Future Considerations / Open Questions

*   **Granularity of Summaries:** Should users be able to request different types or lengths of summaries (e.g., "brief overview" vs. "detailed log")?
*   **Automatic Session Start/End Detection:** Could Roo Commander intelligently suggest starting or ending a session based on prolonged inactivity or a clear shift in topic? This would require careful tuning to avoid being intrusive.
*   **Session Templates:** Beyond the default, could users define or select different "types" of sessions (e.g., "Debugging Session," "Feature Planning Session") that come with pre-defined artifact structures or initial checklist items in the log?
*   **Cross-linking Sessions:** How to best represent and navigate links between sessions, especially when one session extends or is inspired by multiple previous ones?
*   **UI for Session Management:** While command-line and intent-driven interactions are primary, could a simple VS Code Tree View or Webview provide a visual interface for managing sessions and their artifacts?
*   **Resource Management for Summarization:** How to manage the computational cost if many large sessions are frequently summarized?
*   **Integration with MDTM:** Deeper integration, such as automatically creating an MDTM task from a session goal or linking session artifacts directly within MDTM task files.

This whitepaper serves as a starting point for discussion and development of these enhanced session interaction capabilities within Roo Commander.

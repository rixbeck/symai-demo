# Whitepaper: Session Management V6 - Enhanced Context & Streamlined Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the evolution of Session Management within the Roo Commander workspace, introducing **Session Management V6**. This iteration refines the purpose of session artifacts, streamlines confirmation workflows, and enhances the system's ability to capture and leverage rich contextual information, ultimately improving traceability, continuity, and the effectiveness of AI collaboration.

## 1. The "Why": Shift in Artifact Purpose - From Confirmation to Context

Session Management V5 introduced session artifacts primarily as a mechanism for confirming potentially destructive actions like file edits (`CONFIRM-*.md` files). While valuable for safety, this overloaded the artifact system and sometimes created unnecessary friction.

**V6 shifts the primary purpose of session artifacts (`.ruru/sessions/[ID]/artifacts/`) towards capturing rich, unstructured contextual notes.** The goal is to create a persistent, detailed narrative of the session's activities beyond the structured log entries in `session_log.md`. Confirmation, when necessary, is handled more directly (see Section 2).

## 2. Streamlining Confirmation: Eliminating the `CONFIRM-*.md` Workflow

A key change in V6 is the **complete removal of the dedicated confirmation artifact workflow** (previously Section 7 of Rule `RULE-SESSION-MGMT-STANDARD-V5`).

*   **No More `CONFIRM-*.md`:** Modes will no longer create `CONFIRM-[...].md` files containing proposed changes for user review before delegation to an executor.
*   **Direct Confirmation via `ask_followup_question`:** When a Coordinator mode determines that user confirmation *is* required before proceeding with an action (especially file modifications), it **MUST** use the `ask_followup_question` tool directly.
    *   The question should clearly state the intended action and target (e.g., "I propose modifying `path/to/file.js` to implement the user login logic. Do you approve?").
    *   If the proposed change is complex, the Coordinator might first write the *proposed content* to a *standard* session artifact (e.g., `artifacts/proposed_login_logic.js`) and reference this artifact path within the `ask_followup_question` for the user to review. This artifact is purely for review context, not part of a rigid confirmation workflow.
*   **Executor Instruction:** The delegation message to the executor mode will simply state whether user confirmation was obtained or skipped (based on Coordinator assessment of risk), removing the need for the executor to read a separate confirmation artifact.

This change simplifies the workflow, reduces artifact clutter, and leverages the direct interaction capabilities of `ask_followup_question` for necessary user approvals.

## 3. The Power of Contextual Notes in Artifacts

With artifacts freed from the confirmation workflow, their primary role becomes capturing the "texture" of the session. Modes (especially Coordinators and specialists engaged in complex tasks) are encouraged to create artifact files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.log`, code snippets, etc.) within the session's `artifacts/` directory to record:

*   **Decisions & Rationale:** Why was a particular approach chosen? What alternatives were considered?
*   **Learnings:** Insights gained during research or implementation.
*   **Environment Details:** Specific versions, configurations, or observations about the user's setup relevant to the session.
*   **Emergent Ideas:** Thoughts or potential future tasks sparked during the session.
*   **Blockers:** Detailed descriptions of issues encountered.
*   **Q&A:** Snippets of important questions asked and answers received.
*   **Code Snippets:** Useful pieces of code generated or referenced.
*   **User Feedback:** Direct quotes or summaries of user input during the session.
*   **Feature Notes:** Detailed brainstorming or refinement related to a feature.
*   **Context References:** Links or paths to external documentation or internal files used.
*   **Deferred Items:** Notes on tasks or ideas explicitly postponed.

These notes provide invaluable context that might be too verbose for the main `session_log.md`.

## 4. Ensuring Continuity & Enabling Summarization

The rich contextual notes stored in session artifacts serve several crucial purposes:

*   **Continuity:** They act as a bridge between individual tasks or even across different sessions working towards the same high-level goal. When resuming work, modes can consult these artifacts to quickly regain context.
*   **Summarization:** These artifacts provide excellent source material for summarization agents (like `agent-session-summarizer`). Summarizers can process the `session_log.md` and the linked artifacts to generate concise overviews of progress, decisions, and outcomes, facilitating handovers and reporting.

## 5. Maintaining a Hybrid Structure: Global Entities, Session Links

Session Management V6 retains the hybrid approach to information organization:

*   **Global Entities:** Core project artifacts like MDTM task files (`.ruru/tasks/`) and Architecture Decision Records (`.ruru/decisions/`) remain in their dedicated global directories. These represent distinct, often long-lived work units or decisions.
*   **Session Hub:** The `session_log.md` file acts as a central hub for a specific interaction period. It links to relevant global entities via the `related_tasks` (for MDTM Task IDs) and `related_artifacts` (for files within the session's `artifacts/` directory) fields in its TOML frontmatter. It can also reference ADRs or other global documents in its Markdown log entries.

This structure allows specific work units (MDTM tasks) and key decisions (ADRs) to be managed independently while ensuring the narrative flow and contextual links are captured within the relevant session log.

## 6. Naming Convention Update

To improve clarity and avoid potential collisions or overly long paths, the session directory naming convention is updated to:

`SESSION-[SanitizedGoal]-[YYMMDDHHMM]/`

*   `SESSION-`: Standard prefix.
*   `[SanitizedGoal]`: A brief, filesystem-safe representation of the session's title/goal (e.g., `RefactorAuth`, `ImplementUserProfile`). Keep this concise.
*   `[YYMMDDHHMM]`: Timestamp of session creation (Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute).

*Example:* `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-RefactorAuth-2506050047/`

## Conclusion

Session Management V6 represents a significant refinement focused on leveraging session artifacts for rich context capture while streamlining the confirmation process. By emphasizing detailed note-taking within artifacts and using direct questions for confirmation, V6 aims to improve:

*   **Contextual Depth:** Providing a richer narrative of session activities.
*   **Continuity:** Making it easier to resume work and understand past actions.
*   **Efficiency:** Removing the overhead of the dedicated confirmation artifact workflow.
*   **Summarization:** Offering better source material for automated summaries.
*   **Clarity:** Maintaining a clear separation between session-specific context and global project entities.

This evolution supports more effective human-AI collaboration and better project traceability.

# Advanced Usage: Understanding Workflows & Processes

## 1. Introduction / Goal üéØ

Beyond the immediate rules that guide AI mode behavior, Roo Commander utilizes **Workflows** and **Processes (SOPs)** to define standardized procedures for more complex, multi-step activities. These documented procedures ensure consistency, reliability, and provide a clear "how-to" for both human users and AI agents involved in coordination or specific quality gates.

This guide explains the purpose of the `.ruru/workflows/` and `.ruru/processes/` directories and highlights key standard processes like ACQA, AFR, and PAL.

**Goal:** To help users understand how standardized procedures are documented and used within the Roo Commander framework to manage complex operations.

## 2. Workflows vs. Processes: What's the Difference? ‚ÜîÔ∏è

While related, these terms represent different levels of procedural detail:

*   **Workflows (`.ruru/workflows/`)**
    *   **Focus:** High-level, end-to-end sequences involving **multiple phases and often multiple agent roles**.
    *   **Purpose:** Define the overall orchestration for achieving a significant project goal (e.g., creating a new mode, onboarding a project, releasing a build).
    *   **Characteristics:** Describe the flow of control, key decision points, delegation patterns, and major inputs/outputs between phases and roles. May reference specific Processes (SOPs) for detailed steps within a phase.
    *   **Example:** `WF-NEW-MODE-CREATION-004.md` (describes steps from user request to final mode registration).
    *   **Template:** `.ruru/templates/workflows/00_workflow_boilerplate.md`

*   **Processes (SOPs) (`.ruru/processes/`)**
    *   **Focus:** Granular, step-by-step instructions for a **specific, repeatable task or activity**, often within a single role's domain or acting as a quality gate.
    *   **Purpose:** Define the exact "how-to" for a standard procedure to ensure consistency and correctness (e.g., validating a document, handling a specific type of error, applying QA checks).
    *   **Characteristics:** Detail specific actions, tools, inputs, outputs, and error handling for a well-defined task. Often referenced *by* Workflows.
    *   **Example:** `acqa-process.md` (defines the steps for quality assurance).
    *   **Template:** `.ruru/templates/processes/01_sop_toml_md.md` (preferred) or `00_sop_basic.md`.

**Analogy:** Think of a Workflow as the overall recipe for baking a cake, while a Process (SOP) is the detailed instruction for "how to cream butter and sugar" or "how to test if the cake is done".

## 3. How Are They Used? ‚öôÔ∏è

*   **Guidance for Coordinators:** Modes like `roo-commander`, `session-manager`, or Leads consult these documents (when directed by their rules or KB) to understand how to orchestrate complex tasks.
*   **Standardization:** They ensure common procedures are performed consistently across the team and by different AI agents.
*   **Training & Onboarding:** Serve as documentation for human users learning standard procedures.
*   **Automation Basis:** Provide the logical steps needed for potentially automating parts of these workflows in the future.
*   **Validation:** The Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL) (`.ruru/processes/pal-process.md`) is used to validate the logic and completeness of new Workflows and Processes before they are activated.

## 4. Key Standard Processes üîë

The `.ruru/processes/` directory contains critical standard procedures:

*   **`acqa-process.md` (Adaptive Confidence-based Quality Assurance):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines how AI-generated artifacts (code, docs, config) are reviewed based on the generating agent's confidence score and the user's caution level. It standardizes the QA feedback loop.
    *   **Used By:** Coordinators (`roo-commander`, `roo-dispatch`) after receiving work from specialists.
*   **`afr-process.md` (Adaptive Failure Resolution):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines how to handle *recurring* failures identified during the ACQA process. It focuses on identifying and fixing the root cause (e.g., flawed rule, ambiguous spec) rather than just the symptom.
    *   **Used By:** Coordinators when ACQA flags a repeating issue pattern.
*   **`pal-process.md` (Process Assurance Lifecycle):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the meta-process for creating, reviewing, simulating, and validating *new* Workflows and Processes (like ACQA and AFR themselves) before they are officially adopted.
    *   **Used By:** Anyone creating or significantly modifying documents in `.ruru/workflows/` or `.ruru/processes/`.

## 5. Creating New Workflows & Processes ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Identify Need:** Determine if a recurring or complex procedure requires standardization.
*   **Choose Scope:** Decide if it's a high-level Workflow or a granular Process (SOP).
*   **Select Template:** Use the appropriate boilerplate from `.ruru/templates/workflows/` or `.ruru/templates/processes/`.
*   **Draft & Refine:** Write the steps clearly, defining roles, inputs, outputs, tools, and error handling.
*   **Validate with PAL:** Follow the Process Assurance Lifecycle (`pal-process.md`) including conceptual review and simulation to ensure robustness.
*   **Finalize & Index:** Save the validated document to the correct directory (`.ruru/workflows/` or `.ruru/processes/`) and update the relevant index file in Roo Commander's KB (`kb/10-standard-processes-index.md` or `kb/11-standard-workflows-index.md`).

## 6. Conclusion ‚úÖ

Workflows and Processes are essential for managing complexity and ensuring consistency within the Roo Commander framework. Workflows define the high-level orchestration, while Processes (SOPs) provide the detailed "how-to" for specific activities. Understanding their purpose and location, particularly key standards like ACQA, AFR, and PAL, helps users leverage the full capabilities of the system and contribute to its improvement.

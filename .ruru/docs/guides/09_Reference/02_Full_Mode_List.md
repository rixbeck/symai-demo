# Reference: Full Mode List

## 1. Introduction / Purpose üéØ

This document serves as a direct pointer to the definitive, up-to-date list of all AI agent modes currently available within your Roo Commander workspace configuration.

## 2. Authoritative Source: Generated Summary File üìå

The complete and authoritative list of modes is **automatically generated** by a build script (typically `build_roomodes.js`) and stored in Roo Commander's own Knowledge Base.

*   **Location:** **`.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/kb-available-modes-summary.md`**

**Please refer directly to this file for the most current list.**

## 3. Content Overview üìÑ

The `kb-available-modes-summary.md` file provides a concise overview of each mode, typically including:

*   Mode Slug (e.g., `dev-react`)
*   Display Name & Emoji (e.g., `‚öõÔ∏è React Specialist`)
*   A brief Summary of its core purpose.

Modes are usually grouped by classification or domain for easier navigation.

## 4. Finding More Details üí°

For more detailed information on a specific mode's capabilities, workflow, rules, or KB content, please consult:

*   The mode's definition file: `.ruru/modes/[mode_slug]/[mode_slug].mode.md`
*   The enhanced Mode Selection Guide: `04_Understanding_Modes/02_Mode_Selection_Guide.md`

## 5. Keeping the List Updated üîÑ

Remember that this list is generated based on the mode definition files present in `.ruru/modes/` and registered in `.roomodes`. If you add or remove custom modes, run the `node build_roomodes.js` script from your workspace root to update both the `.roomodes` registry and the `kb-available-modes-summary.md` file.

## 6. Conclusion ‚úÖ

Use the linked `kb-available-modes-summary.md` file as your primary reference for discovering the available modes within your Roo Commander setup.

# Roo Commander Knowledge Base: README

## 1. Introduction / Purpose üéØ

Welcome to the comprehensive Knowledge Base (KB) for the **Roo Commander** framework and its integration with the **IntelliManage** project management system.

This KB serves as the central repository for documentation covering:
*   Core concepts and architecture of Roo Commander and IntelliManage.
*   Detailed explanations of workflows, processes, and standards.
*   Guides for getting started and using specific features.
*   Reference material for modes, commands, and configurations.
*   Best practices for effective usage.

The goal is to provide a clear, structured, and accessible source of truth for both **human users** (developers, project managers, architects) and **AI agents** operating within the Roo Code environment.

## 2. Target Audience üë•

This Knowledge Base is intended for:
*   Users interacting with Roo Commander and IntelliManage.
*   Developers contributing to or customizing the framework.
*   AI Agents (including Roo Commander itself and specialist modes) needing reference information and procedural guidance.

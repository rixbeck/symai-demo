## White Paper: IntelliManage - An AI-Enhanced Project Management Framework for Modern Development Environments (v1.1)

**Abstract:**

Managing software development projects effectively remains a significant challenge, often hampered by disconnected tools, inconsistent methodologies, and difficulties in maintaining context within the development environment. AI-driven development environments present a unique opportunity to integrate project management seamlessly into the developer workflow. This white paper proposes **IntelliManage**, a flexible, structured, and AI-enhanced project management framework designed for integration within environments like Roo Code. IntelliManage utilizes a standard hierarchical structure (Initiatives, Epics, Features, Tasks, Subtasks) overlaid with user-chosen methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, or custom) and leverages AI to automate tracking, reporting, linking, and guidance. Built upon a foundation of structured text files (TOML+Markdown) stored within the `.ruru/projects/` directory structure, IntelliManage supports **multi-project workspaces**, integrates deeply with the development environment and external tools like GitHub, offering clarity, traceability, and intelligent assistance to streamline project execution.

**1. Introduction: The Need for Integrated & Intelligent Project Management**

Traditional project management tools often exist separately from the development environment, leading to context switching, duplicated effort, and stale information. Developers need a system that understands their workflow, integrates with their tools (code editor, version control), and provides relevant context without disrupting flow. The ability to manage **multiple related projects** (e.g., frontend, backend, shared library) within a single workspace is also crucial for modern development practices like monorepos.

Furthermore, the rise of AI in development offers new possibilities. AI can assist not just in coding but also in planning, tracking progress across multiple projects, identifying risks, and maintaining alignment between high-level goals and daily tasks.

Your current AI-driven dev environment, with its foundation of structured TOML+MD tasks, provides the perfect substrate for a more comprehensive system. Learning from sophisticated frameworks like the analyzed Roo Commander system (with its emphasis on structured artifacts, delegation, and context stored within `.ruru`), we can design a project management system that is both powerful and intuitive.

**IntelliManage** is proposed as this integrated framework, designed to bring clarity, structure, multi-project support, and AI-powered assistance directly into the development lifecycle, housed within the familiar `.ruru` structure.

**2. Core Concepts: The IntelliManage Hierarchy**

IntelliManage adopts a standard, hierarchical approach to work breakdown, ensuring strategic alignment from high-level goals down to individual actions within each defined project:

*   **Initiative:** (Optional Highest Level) Represents a large-scale strategic goal or theme, potentially spanning multiple projects within the workspace. *Example: "Reduce Customer Churn by 15% (affecting Frontend & Backend projects)".*
    *   *Implementation:* `.ruru/projects/[project_name]/initiatives/INIT-001_reduce_churn.md` (TOML+MD)
*   **Epic:** A significant body of work delivering substantial value within a specific project, typically too large for a single iteration/sprint. Breaks down an Initiative or stands alone as a major project phase. *Example: "Implement New User Onboarding Experience (Frontend Project)".*
    *   *Implementation:* `.ruru/projects/[project_name]/epics/EPIC-001_user_onboarding.md` (TOML+MD)
*   **Feature:** A distinct piece of functionality or capability within a project that delivers user value and fits within an Epic. *Example: "Interactive Product Tour (Frontend Project)", "Email Verification API (Backend Project)".*
    *   *Implementation:* `.ruru/projects/[project_name]/features/FEAT-001_product_tour.md` (TOML+MD)
*   **Story / Task / Bug:** The primary unit of work for the development team within a project, typically completable within a single sprint or iteration. Stories are user-focused requirements, Tasks are specific actions, Bugs are defects. *Example: "As a new user, I want to see a welcome modal (Frontend)", "Create DB schema for profiles (Backend)", "Fix login button alignment (Frontend)".*
    *   *Implementation:* `.ruru/projects/[project_name]/tasks/TASK-001_welcome_modal_ui.md` (TOML+MD - leveraging your existing format)
*   **Subtask:** Granular steps needed to complete a Story/Task/Bug. *Example: "Design modal layout", "Write modal component code", "Add unit tests for modal".*
    *   *Implementation:* Markdown checklist within the parent Task's `.md` file.
*   **Milestone:** Significant checkpoints or deadlines, often corresponding to the completion of an Epic, multiple Features, or a release within a specific project or across projects. Not work items themselves, but markers against the hierarchy.
    *   *Implementation:* Potentially defined in planning documents or linked via TOML metadata in relevant Epics/Features.

**Benefits of Hierarchy:** Clarity of purpose, traceability across projects, better estimation, easier progress tracking, alignment with strategic goals.

**3. Methodology Integration: Flexibility and Structure**

IntelliManage supports common Agile methodologies on a **per-project basis**, allowing different teams or projects within the same workspace to use different approaches:

*   **Scrum:** Sprints, backlogs (product/sprint), velocity tracking, burndown charts. AI assists with estimation, tracking, and reporting within the context of the selected project.
*   **Kanban:** Workflow visualization (via `status` field), WIP limit concepts, cycle time calculation, bottleneck identification. AI assists with visualization, flow metrics, and identifying stuck tasks for the selected project.
*   **Custom / Manual:** Users define custom workflows and structures per project. AI learns and adapts.

**Templates:** Predefined templates for Scrum or Kanban can set up standard folder structures and TOML fields within a specific project's directory (`.ruru/projects/[project_name]/`). A workspace-level configuration might define available custom templates.

**4. Implementation within the AI Dev Environment**

IntelliManage leverages the existing TOML+MD foundation and integrates deeply, residing within the `.ruru` directory structure:

*   **File Structure:** A dedicated `.ruru/projects/` directory houses all management artifacts. Each project gets its own subdirectory.
    ```
    .ruru/
    â”œâ”€â”€ modes/
    â”œâ”€â”€ processes/
    â”œâ”€â”€ rules-.../

    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ project_config.toml
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€ ... (other .ruru folders)
    .roo/
    â””â”€â”€ ... (Roo rules)
    src/
    â””â”€â”€ ... (Source code)
    ```
*   **Active Project Management:** The system needs a way to identify the "active" project context for commands and queries:
    *   **Explicit Setting:** User command (e.g., `!pm set-active backend_api`) or UI selection.
    *   **Inference:** AI determines context based on open files or recent activity (can be less reliable).
    *   **Prompt Specificity:** User includes project name in prompts (e.g., "Show open tasks for `frontend_app`").
    *   **Configuration:** A workspace-level setting (`.ruru/projects/project_config.toml`?) could define a default project.
*   **TOML+MD Artifacts:** Initiatives, Epics, Features, Tasks/Bugs within each project directory use the standard TOML+MD format.
    *   **Key TOML Fields:** `id`, `title`, `status`, `type`, `priority`, `assigned_to`, `created_date`, `updated_date`, `parent_id`, `epic_id`, `feature_id`, `tags`, `project_name` (explicitly linking to the project).
    *   **Markdown Body:** Descriptions, acceptance criteria, implementation notes, subtask checklists.
*   **AI Integration & Automation:**
    *   **Creation & Linking:** Generate draft artifacts within the specified project. Automatically link items within and potentially *across* projects (e.g., a frontend task depending on a backend API feature).
    *   **Parsing & Understanding:** Parse multi-project requests ("Show high-priority bugs in `frontend_app` and `backend_api`").
    *   **Status Tracking:** Infer status updates from commits/PRs (potentially parsing messages like "Fixes backend_api#TASK-123").
    *   **Reporting & Visualization:** Generate cross-project reports or visualize dependencies between projects.
    *   **Guidance & Refinement:** Assist users in structuring work across multiple related projects.

**5. Flexibility and External Integration**

*   **Manual Configuration:** AI parses natural language descriptions of custom workflows *per project*.
*   **GitHub Integration:**
    *   Map IntelliManage projects to GitHub repositories or specific issue prefixes/labels within a monorepo.
    *   Sync Issues, Labels, Milestones, potentially leveraging GitHub Projects for visualization across multiple IntelliManage projects if mapped correctly.
    *   AI assists with configuration and conflict resolution for multi-project setups.

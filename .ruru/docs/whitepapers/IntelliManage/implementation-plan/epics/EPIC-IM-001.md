# EPIC: Implement IntelliManage Framework v1.0 (with Layered Coordination)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

This Epic covers the complete design, implementation, testing, and documentation of the IntelliManage project management framework v1.0 as specified in the white paper (`WP-INTELLIMANAGE-SESSION-DISPATCH-V1.md`) and associated specification documents. This includes the core file structures, data schemas, CRUD logic, AI integration, methodology support, the layered coordination modes (`session-manager`, `roo-dispatch`), GitHub integration, and user interface components.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] All core components (CLE, AI Engine, File Store, Interaction Layer, Integration Layer) are implemented according to specifications.
*   - [ ] All IntelliManage artifact types (Initiative, Epic, Feature, Task/Story/Bug) can be created, read, updated, and deleted via specified commands/interactions.
*   - [ ] Hierarchical linking between artifacts is functional and validated.
*   - [ ] Subtask management via Markdown checklists is functional.
*   - [ ] Project configuration (`project_config.toml`) is loaded and respected, including methodology settings.
*   - [ ] Scrum and Kanban methodologies are supported with basic AI reporting/visualization.
*   - [ ] Custom methodology statuses are supported.
*   - [ ] Core AI features (artifact generation draft, linking suggestion, status inference suggestion) are implemented.
*   - [ ] `session-manager` mode handles session start/resume and delegates appropriately.
*   - [ ] `roo-dispatch` mode coordinates specialist execution for delegated tasks.
*   - [ ] `agent-session-summarizer` generates handover summaries according to the specified format.
*   - [ ] Basic GitHub integration (Issue<->Task sync, Label<->Metadata sync) is functional (if enabled).
*   - [ ] `!pm` command structure is implemented and functional for core operations.
*   - [ ] Core unit and integration tests pass.
*   - [ ] Setup and Usage documentation is complete and accurate.

# Feature: Implement Core Framework & Data Structures

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the foundational components of IntelliManage, including the file system structure, TOML schema validation, Core Logic Engine (CLE) for CRUD operations, and linking mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Code exists to create/validate the `.ruru/projects/[project_slug]/` directory structure.
*   - [ ] TOML parsing and validation library/module is implemented or integrated.
*   - [ ] Schemas defined in `DOC-SCHEMA-001` are implemented for validation.
*   - [ ] Core Logic Engine (CLE) base is implemented.
*   - [ ] CLE can perform validated CRUD operations for Initiatives, Epics, Features, and Tasks/Stories/Bugs according to `DOC-FUNC-SPEC-001`.
*   - [ ] CLE correctly handles hierarchical linking (`parent_id`, `epic_id`, `feature_id`) during CRUD operations.
*   - [ ] CLE correctly handles dependency linking (`depends_on`).
*   - [ ] CLE can read/write/update subtask checklists within Markdown bodies.
*   - [ ] CLE can load and parse workspace (`projects_config.toml`) and project (`project_config.toml`) configurations.
*   - [ ] Unit tests exist for schema validation and core CRUD/linking logic.

# Feature: Implement AI Engine Capabilities

## Description ✍️

Implement the core AI-driven functionalities specified for IntelliManage, enabling intelligent assistance, automation, and analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [ ] AI Engine can receive requests from coordinators (Session Manager, Roo Dispatch, Roo Commander).
*   - [ ] AI Engine can interact with the CLE to request data.
*   - [ ] AI Engine can interact with external LLMs for generation/analysis.
*   - [ ] Artifact Generation: AI can create draft artifacts based on NL prompts.
*   - [ ] Automated Linking: AI can suggest relevant parent/child/dependency links.
*   - [ ] Status Inference: AI can parse events (Git/Chat) and suggest status updates (with confirmation).
*   - [ ] Reporting: AI can generate basic methodology-aware reports (e.g., text-based board, sprint summary).
*   - [ ] Guidance: AI can offer basic suggestions for improving artifact descriptions or breaking down tasks.
*   - [ ] NLP: AI can parse basic natural language commands for PM actions.

## Tasks 📝

*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-301:** Define AI Engine interfaces and interaction points with CLE and Coordinators. (Ref: `DOC-AI-SPEC-001`)
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-302:** Implement Artifact Generation capability (NL -> Draft TOML/MD -> CLE Create).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-303:** Implement Automated Linking suggestion logic (Keyword analysis -> CLE Query -> Suggestion).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-304:** Implement Status Tracking/Inference logic (Event parsing -> Suggestion -> CLE Update on confirm).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-305:** Implement basic Reporting capability (CLE Query -> LLM Summarization/Formatting -> Output).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-306:** Implement basic Guidance/Refinement suggestion capability (Analyze artifact -> LLM Suggestion).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-307:** Implement core NLP command parsing (NL -> Structured `!pm` equivalent).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-308:** Implement AI logic to read methodology from config via CLE for reporting.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-309:** Write integration tests for AI -> CLE interactions.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-310:** Write tests for core AI capabilities (e.g., linking suggestions, status inference).

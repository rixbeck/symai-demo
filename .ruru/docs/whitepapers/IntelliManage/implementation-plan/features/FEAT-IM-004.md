# Feature: Implement Session Manager Mode (`session-manager`)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Create and implement the `session-manager` mode, responsible for user interaction, session state, high-level goal tracking, and primary delegation within IntelliManage.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] `session-manager.mode.md` file created according to spec (`MODE-SPEC-SESSION-MANAGER-001`).
*   - [ ] `.roo/rules-session-manager/` directory and rules created according to spec (`RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001`).
*   - [ ] `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/` directory and KB outline implemented (`KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001`).
*   - [ ] Session start/resume logic correctly loads/ignores handover summaries.
*   - [ ] Session goal elicitation and tracking functions correctly.
*   - [ ] Correctly delegates direct `!pm` commands to CLE.
*   - [ ] Correctly delegates development tasks to `roo-dispatch`.
*   - [ ] Correctly delegates summary generation to `agent-session-summarizer`.
*   - [ ] Correctly reports outcomes from delegates back to the user.
*   - [ ] Session logging to `.ruru/sessions/` is functional.
*   - [ ] Active project context is managed correctly.
*   - [ ] Basic error handling and escalation path to `roo-commander` is implemented.

## Tasks üìù

*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-401:** Create mode definition file `session-manager.mode.md`. (Ref: `MODE-SPEC-SESSION-MANAGER-001`)

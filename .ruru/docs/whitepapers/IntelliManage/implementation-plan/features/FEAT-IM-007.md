# Feature: Implement GitHub & Git Integration

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the Integration Layer responsible for connecting IntelliManage with GitHub (Issues, Labels, Milestones) and monitoring local Git events.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Integration Layer component structure is implemented.
*   - [ ] GitHub API client is integrated with secure PAT handling (reads from env var).
*   - [ ] Bi-directional sync logic for Issues <-> Tasks/Stories/Bugs is implemented according to `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001`.
*   - [ ] Bi-directional sync logic for Labels <-> Metadata (Status, Type, Priority, Tags) is implemented.
*   - [ ] Bi-directional sync logic for Milestones <-> Epics/Features is implemented.
*   - [ ] Configured conflict resolution strategy is applied.
*   - [ ] Git commit message scanning logic is implemented to identify keywords and artifact IDs.
*   - [ ] Automatic linking of commits/PRs to artifacts is functional.
*   - [ ] AI suggestion for status updates based on commit keywords is functional (requires confirmation).
*   - [ ] Integration can be enabled/disabled per project via `project_config.toml`.
*   - [ ] Basic error handling for API calls and sync conflicts is implemented.

## Tasks üìù

*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-701:** Implement Integration Layer base structure and interface with CLE. (Ref: `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001`)

# Feature: Implement User Interaction Layer (Commands & UI)

## Description ✍️

Implement the primary user interface mechanisms for interacting with IntelliManage, focusing initially on the `!pm` chat commands.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [ ] `!pm` command prefix is recognized by the Interaction Layer.
*   - [ ] Command parser correctly identifies verb, artifact type, identifier, and options.
*   - [ ] Parser handles quoted strings and flag formats correctly.
*   - [ ] Commands are correctly routed to the appropriate component (CLE, Session Manager, AI Engine).
*   - [ ] `!pm help` command provides general and command-specific help.
*   - [ ] System provides clear confirmation messages for successful actions.
*   - [ ] System provides informative error messages for invalid commands or failed operations.
*   - [ ] Basic natural language equivalents for common commands (e.g., create task, list bugs) are parsed by the AI Engine and trigger the correct actions.

## Tasks 📝

*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-801:** Implement `!pm` command prefix detection. (Ref: `DOC-UI-CMD-SPEC-001`)
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-802:** Implement command string parser (verb, type, ID, options flags).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-803:** Implement routing logic based on parsed command verb/type.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-804:** Implement `!pm help` functionality.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-805:** Standardize confirmation message formats.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-806:** Standardize error message formats.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-807:** Implement NLP -> Command translation for core create/list/update actions (via AI Engine).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-808:** Write tests for command parser and routing logic.
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-809:** (Future) Design specifications for UI panels (Explorer, Board).
*   - [ ] **TASK-IM-810:** (Future) Implement UI panels.

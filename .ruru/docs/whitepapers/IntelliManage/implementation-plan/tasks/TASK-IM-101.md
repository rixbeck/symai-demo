# Task: Implement File System Structure generation and validation logic

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the necessary code within the Core Logic Engine (or a dedicated utility module) to:
1.  Automatically generate the standard IntelliManage directory structure (`.ruru/projects/[project_slug]/[subdirs]`) when a new project is initialized.
2.  Validate the existence and basic structure of the IntelliManage directories upon system startup or when specific operations require it.
3.  Ensure adherence to the naming conventions specified in `DOC-FS-SPEC-001`.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Function exists to create the full directory structure for a new project slug (e.g., `createProjectStructure(projectSlug)`).
*   - [ ] Function creates `.ruru/projects/[project_slug]/` and all standard subdirectories (`initiatives`, `epics`, `features`, `tasks`, `decisions`, `reports`, `planning`).
*   - [ ] Function exists to validate the presence of the core IntelliManage structure for a given project slug (e.g., `validateProjectStructure(projectSlug)`).
*   - [ ] The `!pm init project` command correctly utilizes the structure generation function.
*   - [ ] Errors are handled gracefully if directories cannot be created (e.g., permissions issues).
*   - [ ] Code adheres to project coding standards.
*   - [ ] Unit tests cover structure generation and validation logic.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Consider using standard library functions for directory creation (e.g., `fs.mkdir` in Node.js with `recursive: true`).
*   Validation might involve checking for the existence of the main project directory and key subdirectories like `tasks/`.
*   Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) regarding path separators.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Design the interface for the structure generation function.
*   - [ ] Implement the directory creation logic.
*   - [ ] Design the interface for the structure validation function.
*   - [ ] Implement the directory validation logic.
*   - [ ] Integrate generation logic with the `!pm init project` flow.
*   - [ ] Add error handling for file system operations.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for generation function.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for validation function.

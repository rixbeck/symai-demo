# Task: Integrate/Implement TOML parsing and validation module

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Select, integrate, or implement a robust library or module capable of:
1.  Parsing TOML content, specifically the frontmatter within IntelliManage `.md` artifact files and the content of `.toml` configuration files.
2.  Validating the parsed TOML data against predefined schemas (as specified in `DOC-SCHEMA-001`).

This module will be a core dependency for the Core Logic Engine (CLE) to ensure data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A suitable TOML parsing library is chosen and added as a project dependency (e.g., `@iarna/toml` for Node.js, `toml` for Python).
*   - [ ] A schema validation approach/library is chosen (e.g., Zod, Ajv, Pydantic, or custom validation logic).
*   - [ ] A wrapper function/module exists that takes TOML content (string) and a schema definition as input.
*   - [ ] The wrapper function successfully parses valid TOML content into a structured data object (e.g., JSON/dictionary).
*   - [ ] The wrapper function successfully validates the parsed data object against the provided schema.
*   - [ ] The wrapper function returns the validated data object on success.
*   - [ ] The wrapper function returns clear error information (e.g., parsing errors, validation failures with field details) on failure.
*   - [ ] Code adheres to project coding standards.
*   - [ ] Unit tests cover parsing of valid/invalid TOML and validation against schemas (required fields, types, enum values).

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Evaluate different TOML libraries for robustness, maintenance status, and ease of use.
*   Evaluate schema validation libraries for flexibility and clarity of error reporting. Consider if custom validation logic is simpler for the defined schemas.
*   The validation should check for required fields, correct data types (String, Integer, Boolean, Array, Date format), and allowed enum values (for `status`, `type`, `priority`).
*   Error messages should be specific enough to help users or other system components identify the problem (e.g., "Missing required field 'title'", "Invalid value 'In Progresss' for field 'status'. Allowed values are [...]").

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Research and select a TOML parsing library.
*   - [ ] Research and select a schema validation library/approach.
*   - [ ] Add chosen libraries as project dependencies.
*   - [ ] Implement the core parsing function.
*   - [ ] Implement the core schema validation logic.
*   - [ ] Integrate parsing and validation into a single wrapper module/function.
*   - [ ] Implement clear error handling and reporting for parsing/validation failures.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for TOML parsing (valid and invalid syntax).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for schema validation (various success and failure cases).

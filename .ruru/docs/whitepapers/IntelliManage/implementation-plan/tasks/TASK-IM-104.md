# Task: Implement Core Logic Engine (CLE) base structure/interface

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Establish the foundational code structure for the Core Logic Engine (CLE). This involves defining the main class, module, or set of functions that will encapsulate the core IntelliManage logic. Define the primary interfaces or methods that other components (like the Interaction Layer, AI Engine, or coordination modes) will use to interact with the CLE for performing CRUD operations, validation, linking, and accessing configuration.

This task focuses on the *structure and interface definition*, not the full implementation of all methods (which will be covered in subsequent tasks).

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A dedicated module/class/directory exists for the Core Logic Engine code.
*   - [ ] The CLE structure clearly separates concerns (e.g., file operations, validation, artifact logic).
*   - [ ] Interfaces/method signatures are defined for core CRUD operations (e.g., `createArtifact`, `readArtifact`, `updateArtifact`, `deleteArtifact`).
*   - [ ] Interfaces/method signatures are defined for listing/querying artifacts (e.g., `findArtifacts`, `listArtifacts`).
*   - [ ] Interfaces/method signatures are defined for linking operations (e.g., `linkArtifacts`, `unlinkArtifacts`).
*   - [ ] Interfaces/method signatures are defined for accessing project/workspace configuration (e.g., `getProjectConfig`, `getWorkspaceConfig`).
*   - [ ] The CLE structure allows for easy integration of the File System logic (`TASK-IM-101`) and Validation module (`TASK-IM-102`, `TASK-IM-103`).
*   - [ ] Basic error handling structure (e.g., custom error types) is defined.
*   - [ ] Code adheres to project coding standards and architectural principles.
*   - [ ] Placeholder implementations or stubs exist for the defined interfaces/methods.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Decide on the primary architectural pattern for the CLE (e.g., a central class instance, a collection of static functions, a service locator pattern).
*   Consider dependency injection for passing in dependencies like the file system utility and validator module.
*   Define clear input parameters and return types for each interface method (including potential error states).
*   Think about how the active project context (`project_slug`) will be passed to or managed by the CLE methods.
*   Use clear naming conventions for methods and parameters.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Choose the primary architectural pattern for the CLE (Class, Module, etc.).
*   - [ ] Create the main file(s) and directory structure for the CLE.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for `createArtifact`.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for `readArtifact`.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for `updateArtifact`.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for `deleteArtifact`.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for `findArtifacts` / `listArtifacts`.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for linking/unlinking operations.
*   - [ ] Define the interface/method signature for configuration access.
*   - [ ] Define custom error types for CLE operations (e.g., `ArtifactNotFoundError`, `ValidationError`, `FileSystemError`).
*   - [ ] Implement basic stubs/placeholder logic for each defined method.
*   - [ ] Set up dependency injection or integration points for FS logic and Validation module.
*   - [ ] Add initial documentation (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings) for the CLE interface.

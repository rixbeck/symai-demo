# Task: Implement CLE CRUD & Linking for Epics

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the specific logic within the Core Logic Engine (CLE) to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for **Epic** artifacts. This includes generating unique IDs, constructing filenames, interacting with the file system module, parsing/validating TOML frontmatter against the Epic schema, and handling Epic-specific fields, including the optional `initiative_id` link.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] `createArtifact` method (or equivalent) correctly handles `type="üó∫Ô∏è Epic"`:
    *   - [ ] Generates a unique Epic ID (e.g., `EPIC-NNN`) within the project scope.
    *   - [ ] Constructs the correct filename (`EPIC-ID_description.md`).
    *   - [ ] Populates required fields (`id`, `title`, `status`, `type`, `created_date`, `updated_date`, `project_name`) in TOML.
    *   - [ ] Correctly handles the optional `initiative_id` field if provided.
    *   - [ ] Validates input data against the Epic schema (`TASK-IM-103`).
    *   - [ ] Uses the file system module (`TASK-IM-101`) to write the file to the correct `epics/` directory.
*   - [ ] `readArtifact` method correctly reads and parses an Epic file given its ID and project slug.
*   - [ ] `updateArtifact` method correctly handles Epic updates:
    *   - [ ] Reads the existing file.
    *   - [ ] Validates proposed changes against the Epic schema.
    *   - [ ] Updates specified TOML fields (including `initiative_id`) or Markdown body.
    *   - [ ] **MUST** update the `updated_date` field.
    *   - [ ] Writes changes back to the file.
*   - [ ] `deleteArtifact` method correctly handles Epic deletion/archival.
*   - [ ] `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` method can filter and return Epic artifacts based on criteria (status, tags, `initiative_id`, etc.).
*   - [ ] Appropriate CLE errors are thrown for invalid operations.
*   - [ ] Unit tests cover CRUD operations specifically for Epics, including handling of the `initiative_id` link.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Implement the logic within the methods/interfaces defined in `TASK-IM-104`.
*   Ensure interaction with the file system module (`TASK-IM-101`) and validation module (`TASK-IM-102`/`TASK-IM-103`) is correct.
*   Handle Epic ID generation (project-specific sequence).
*   Implement filename generation based on ID and title.
*   Ensure `updated_date` is always set correctly on updates.
*   Validate the format of `initiative_id` if provided (optional: check if the Initiative exists).

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Implement `createArtifact` logic specific to Epics (ID gen, filename, path, schema validation, `initiative_id`).
*   - [ ] Implement `readArtifact` logic specific to Epics (path construction, parsing).
*   - [ ] Implement `updateArtifact` logic specific to Epics (validation, field updates including `initiative_id`, `updated_date`).
*   - [ ] Implement `deleteArtifact` logic specific to Epics.
*   - [ ] Implement filtering logic for Epics within `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts`.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for `createArtifact` (Epic).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for `readArtifact` (Epic).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for `updateArtifact` (Epic, including `initiative_id` changes).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for `deleteArtifact` (Epic).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for listing/filtering Epics.

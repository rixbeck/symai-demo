# Task: Write unit tests for CLE CRUD operations

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the Core Logic Engine (CLE) methods responsible for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on all IntelliManage artifact types (Initiative, Epic, Feature, Task/Story/Bug). These tests should mock dependencies like the file system module and validation module to isolate the CLE's logic for testing.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Unit tests exist for the `createArtifact` method covering all artifact types.
*   - [ ] Unit tests exist for the `readArtifact` method covering all artifact types.
*   - [ ] Unit tests exist for the `updateArtifact` method covering all artifact types and common field updates.
*   - [ ] Unit tests exist for the `deleteArtifact` method covering all artifact types.
*   - [ ] Unit tests exist for the `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` method covering various filter criteria for different artifact types.
*   - [ ] Tests verify correct interaction with mocked dependencies (e.g., correct paths passed to file system mock, correct schema passed to validation mock).
*   - [ ] Tests verify correct handling of required fields during creation (e.g., `epic_id` for Feature, `feature_id`/`type` for Task).
*   - [ ] Tests verify correct ID generation and filename construction.
*   - [ ] Tests verify correct updating of the `updated_date` field during updates.
*   - [ ] Tests verify correct handling of successful operations (e.g., returning created/read artifact data).
*   - [ ] Tests verify correct error handling (e.g., throwing `ArtifactNotFoundError`, `ValidationError` when mocks indicate failure).
*   - [ ] Tests are added to the project's automated test suite.
*   - [ ] Test coverage for the CLE CRUD logic meets project standards.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Use the project's standard unit testing framework and mocking libraries (e.g., Jest mocks, Python unittest.mock, Go interfaces/mocks).
*   Mock the file system interaction module (`TASK-IM-101`) to simulate file reads, writes, deletes, and existence checks without touching the actual file system.
*   Mock the TOML parsing/validation module (`TASK-IM-102`/`TASK-IM-103`) to simulate successful validation or specific validation errors.
*   Focus tests on the logic *within* the CLE methods, assuming the mocked dependencies behave as expected.
*   Organize tests logically, likely per artifact type or per CRUD operation.
*   Use clear and descriptive test case names.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Set up test file/suite structure for CLE CRUD tests.
*   - [ ] Implement mocks for File System module interactions.
*   - [ ] Implement mocks for TOML Validation module interactions.
*   - [ ] Write tests for `createArtifact` (Initiative, Epic, Feature, Task/Story/Bug - success and validation failure cases).
*   - [ ] Write tests for `readArtifact` (success and file not found cases).
*   - [ ] Write tests for `updateArtifact` (success, validation failure, file not found cases, `updated_date` check).
*   - [ ] Write tests for `deleteArtifact` (success, file not found cases).
*   - [ ] Write tests for `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` (various filter combinations, empty results).
*   - [ ] Ensure tests cover specific requirements like mandatory parent IDs.
*   - [ ] Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline if applicable.
*   - [ ] Review test coverage reports for CLE CRUD logic.

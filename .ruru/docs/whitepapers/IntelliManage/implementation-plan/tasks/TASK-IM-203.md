# Task: Add handling for `sprint_id` field in Task/Story/Bug TOML schema and CRUD operations

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Update the IntelliManage system to fully support the optional `sprint_id` field within the TOML frontmatter of Task/Story/Bug artifacts, as defined in the schema (`DOC-SCHEMA-001`). This involves:
1.  Ensuring the schema definition (`TASK-IM-103`) correctly includes `sprint_id` as an optional string.
2.  Modifying the Core Logic Engine (CLE) CRUD operations (`TASK-IM-108`) to correctly read, write, and update the `sprint_id` field.
3.  Enabling filtering by `sprint_id` in the `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` method.

This field is primarily used when a project's methodology is set to "Scrum".

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The Task/Story/Bug schema definition (`TASK-IM-103`) includes `sprint_id` as an optional string field.
*   - [ ] The validation module (`TASK-IM-102`) correctly validates the `sprint_id` field (accepts strings, rejects other types if provided).
*   - [ ] The `createArtifact` method for Tasks/Stories/Bugs can optionally accept and store a `sprint_id`.
*   - [ ] The `readArtifact` method for Tasks/Stories/Bugs correctly reads and returns the `sprint_id` if present.
*   - [ ] The `updateArtifact` method for Tasks/Stories/Bugs can add, modify, or remove the `sprint_id` field.
*   - [ ] The `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` method supports filtering artifacts by a specific `sprint_id`.
*   - [ ] Unit tests (`TASK-IM-111`, `TASK-IM-112`) are updated or added to cover `sprint_id` handling in schema validation and CRUD operations.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Modify the Task/Story/Bug schema definition created in `TASK-IM-103`.
*   Update the implementation of `createArtifact`, `readArtifact`, and `updateArtifact` within the CLE (`TASK-IM-108`) to handle the `sprint_id` field during TOML parsing and writing.
*   Extend the filtering logic within `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` to check the `sprint_id` field when a corresponding filter parameter is provided.
*   The `sprint_id` is just a string identifier; validation of whether the sprint *exists* in the project config is not part of this task (though it could be a future enhancement or handled by the AI/UI layer).

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Update Task/Story/Bug schema definition to include optional `sprint_id` (String).
*   - [ ] Update `createArtifact` logic to accept and write `sprint_id`.
*   - [ ] Update `readArtifact` logic to read `sprint_id`.
*   - [ ] Update `updateArtifact` logic to add/modify/remove `sprint_id`.
*   - [ ] Update `findArtifacts`/`listArtifacts` filtering logic to support `--sprint-id` filter.
*   - [ ] Add/Update unit tests for schema validation covering `sprint_id`.
*   - [ ] Add/Update unit tests for CRUD operations covering `sprint_id` handling.

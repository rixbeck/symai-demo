# Task: Implement Status Tracking/Inference logic (Event parsing -> Suggestion -> CLE Update on confirm)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the AI Engine capability to infer potential status changes for IntelliManage artifacts based on external events (like Git commits, PR merges) or user chat context. This involves:
1.  Receiving event data (e.g., commit message, chat transcript snippet) via the interface defined in `TASK-IM-301` (e.g., `processEvent(eventData)`).
2.  Parsing the event data to identify relevant keywords (e.g., "Fixes", "Closes", "Refs", "Finished working on") and associated artifact IDs (`TASK-XXX`, `BUG-XXX`).
3.  Inferring a likely new status based on the keywords and context (e.g., "Fixes TASK-123" suggests moving to "üü£ Review" or "üü¢ Done").
4.  Communicating this *suggestion* (including the artifact ID, current status, and proposed new status) back to the appropriate coordinator (`session-manager`) via the defined interface mechanism (e.g., return value, event).
5.  **Crucially:** The AI Engine only *suggests*; the coordinator is responsible for presenting the suggestion to the user and obtaining confirmation before instructing the CLE to perform the actual `updateArtifact` operation.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] AI Engine exposes a method (e.g., `processEvent` or similar) to receive event data (Git commit, chat message).
*   - [ ] The method correctly parses Git commit messages to find keywords (from `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001` config) and associated artifact IDs.
*   - [ ] The method correctly parses simple chat messages to find keywords ("finished", "completed", "working on") and associated artifact IDs.
*   - [ ] Logic exists to map keywords to potential target statuses (e.g., "Fixes" -> "Review/Done", "Refs" -> no status change, "Working on" -> "In Progress").
*   - [ ] The method fetches the artifact's current status via the CLE (`readArtifact`) to provide context for the suggestion.
*   - [ ] The method returns a structured suggestion object (e.g., `{ artifactId: 'TASK-123', currentStatus: '...', suggestedStatus: '...', reason: 'Commit message: Fixes TASK-123' }`) or null/empty if no suggestion is inferred.
*   - [ ] The suggestion logic considers basic workflow validity (e.g., doesn't suggest moving from "Done" back to "In Progress" based on "Refs").
*   - [ ] Unit tests cover parsing of different commit message formats and keywords.
*   - [ ] Unit tests cover parsing of simple chat message formats.
*   - [ ] Unit tests cover the mapping logic from keywords to suggested statuses.
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify the structure and content of the returned suggestion object.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Keyword Configuration:** The keywords used for Git commit parsing should ideally be configurable (as defined in `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001` and loaded via `TASK-IM-110`).
*   **Status Mapping:** Define the mapping from keywords to suggested statuses clearly. This might need refinement based on team workflows. Consider mapping "Fixes/Closes/Resolves" to "üü£ Review" by default if a review step exists, otherwise "üü¢ Done". "Refs" or "Relates to" should generally not trigger a status change suggestion. "Started/Working on" could suggest "üîµ In Progress".
*   **Confirmation is External:** Re-emphasize that this task *only* implements the *suggestion* logic within the AI Engine. The user confirmation step happens in the coordinator (`session-manager`) which then calls `CLE.updateArtifact`.
*   **Context:** Fetching the current status via CLE is important to avoid suggesting redundant changes (e.g., suggesting "Done" if already "Done").
*   **Chat Parsing:** Keep initial chat parsing simple, looking for basic patterns like "[action verb] [artifact ID]". More complex NLP can be added later.

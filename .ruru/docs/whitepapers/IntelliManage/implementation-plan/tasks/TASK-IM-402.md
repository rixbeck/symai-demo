# Task: Create rules directory and implement rules files for session-manager

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Create the necessary directory structure for the `session-manager` mode's operational rules (e.g., `.roo/rules-session-manager/`) and implement the initial set of rule files (`.roo`). These rules should codify the core logic and procedures outlined in the `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001` specification document.

This involves translating the procedural steps defined in the specification (like session start/resume, request handling, delegation logic, error handling) into the specific rule format used by the Roo Code engine.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The directory `.roo/rules-session-manager/` exists.
*   - [ ] Rule files (`*.roo`) are created within the directory to cover the key procedures from `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001`.
*   - [ ] A rule exists implementing the Session Start / Resumption Procedure (checking handover, greeting/prompting).
*   - [ ] A rule exists implementing Active Project Context Management (identifying/confirming context).
*   - [ ] Rule(s) exist implementing User Request Handling & Delegation logic (parsing intent, routing to CLE/dispatch/summarizer).
*   - [ ] A rule exists implementing Session Logging Procedure (writing key events to log file).
*   - [ ] Rule(s) exist implementing Error Handling & Escalation logic (reporting delegate errors, escalating persistent failures).
*   - [ ] The implemented rules correctly reference necessary tools (`list_files`, `read_file`, `ask_followup_question`, `new_task`, `edit` tools, etc.).
*   - [ ] The rules are written according to the Roo Code rule syntax and best practices.
*   - [ ] The rules files are added to version control (Git).

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This task requires a good understanding of the Roo Code rule engine syntax and capabilities.
*   Break down the procedures from `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001` into logical rule files (e.g., `01_session_start.roo`, `02_request_handler.roo`, `03_delegate_dispatch.roo`, `04_logging.roo`, `05_error_handling.roo`).
*   Focus on implementing the core flow and decision logic described in the specification.
*   Ensure rules correctly handle variables for context (e.g., `[Session Goal]`, `[project_slug]`, `[Session Log Path]`).
*   Initial implementation might use placeholder logic for complex parts, to be refined later.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Create the directory `.roo/rules-session-manager/`.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for Session Start / Resumption logic.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for Active Project Context management.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for parsing user requests and identifying action type.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for delegating direct PM commands to CLE.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for delegating development tasks to `roo-dispatch`.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for delegating summary generation to `agent-session-summarizer`.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for session logging.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for handling errors reported by delegates.
*   - [ ] Implement rule(s) for escalating to `roo-commander`.
*   - [ ] Add comments within rule files explaining the logic.
*   - [ ] Add the new rule files to Git staging.
*   - [ ] Perform basic validation or linting of rule syntax if tools are available.

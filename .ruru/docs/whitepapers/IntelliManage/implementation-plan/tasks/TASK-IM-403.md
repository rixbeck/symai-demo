# Task: Create KB directory and populate initial KB content for session-manager

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Create the Knowledge Base (KB) directory structure for the `session-manager` mode (`.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/`) and populate the initial set of Markdown files (`.md`) based on the structure and content outlines defined in `KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001`.

This involves writing the detailed procedural documentation, guidelines, and reference information that the `session-manager` mode will use to guide its own behavior according to the specified rules and best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The directory `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/` exists.
*   - [ ] All Markdown files outlined in `KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001` are created within the directory (e.g., `README.md`, `00-kb-usage-strategy.md`, `01-session-lifecycle.md`, etc.).
*   - [ ] Each KB file contains initial content covering the topics specified in the outline.
*   - [ ] Content accurately reflects the procedures and logic defined in `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001` and `MODE-SPEC-SESSION-MANAGER-001`.
*   - [ ] Content is written clearly and concisely, suitable for an AI agent to parse and understand.
*   - [ ] Formatting (Markdown) is correct and consistent across files.
*   - [ ] Placeholders for future details or refinements are noted where necessary.
*   - [ ] The KB files are added to version control (Git).

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This task involves translating the outlines and rule specifications into detailed procedural text within Markdown files.
*   Use clear headings, bullet points, and code blocks (for examples) to structure the content.
*   Write from the perspective of instructing the `session-manager` mode itself.
*   Ensure consistency in terminology with other specification documents.
*   The initial population might not be exhaustive but should cover the core logic outlined. Refinements can occur later.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Create the directory `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/`.
*   - [ ] Create and populate `README.md` (KB overview and index).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `00-kb-usage-strategy.md` (standard usage strategy).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `01-session-lifecycle.md` (detailed start/resume/end procedures).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `02-goal-management.md` (goal elicitation/tracking techniques).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `03-request-parsing.md` (guidelines for interpreting input).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `04-delegation-patterns.md` (rules/examples for delegation).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `05-error-handling-escalation.md` (error/escalation procedures).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `06-session-logging.md` (logging standards/examples).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `07-context-management.md` (active project context handling).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `08-handover-summary-usage.md` (interpreting handover summaries).
*   - [ ] Review content for clarity, accuracy, and consistency with specifications.
*   - [ ] Add the new KB files to Git staging.

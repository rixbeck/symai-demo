# Task: Implement delegation logic for `roo-dispatch`

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the specific logic within the `session-manager` mode's rules (`TASK-IM-402`) to delegate a development task to the `roo-dispatch` mode using the `new_task` tool/command. This task focuses on constructing and sending the delegation message correctly after the routing logic (`TASK-IM-406`) has identified a development task.

This involves:
1.  Gathering the necessary context determined by the routing logic (task goal description, relevant artifact IDs like `TASK-XXX`, active `project_slug`).
2.  Formatting the context and instructions into the message payload for the `new_task` command targeting `roo-dispatch`.
3.  Executing the `new_task` command.
4.  Handling the immediate response from `new_task` (e.g., task ID assigned by the system).
5.  Setting up the expectation to receive an `attempt_completion` signal from `roo-dispatch` later.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Rule(s) exist within `session-manager` that are triggered when a development task needs delegation to `roo-dispatch`.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly gather the task goal description.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly gather relevant artifact IDs (e.g., the primary `TASK-ID` to be worked on).
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly identify and include the active `project_slug`.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly format the message payload for `new_task` according to the expected input format for `roo-dispatch` (as per `MODE-SPEC-ROO-DISPATCH-001`).
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly execute the `new_task` command targeting the `roo-dispatch` mode ID.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) store or handle the task ID returned by `new_task` for potential future reference (e.g., logging).
*   - [ ] The mode correctly anticipates an `attempt_completion` response corresponding to this delegation.
*   - [ ] Unit tests (or rule tests) verify the correct construction and execution of the `new_task` command for `roo-dispatch`.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This logic follows directly from the "Development Task" branch identified in `TASK-IM-406`.
*   Focus on correctly packaging the necessary context. `roo-dispatch` is stateless and relies entirely on the information passed in this delegation message (and any artifacts it subsequently reads based on IDs in the message).
*   The message should be clear and instruct `roo-dispatch` on the primary goal (e.g., "Implement the feature described in TASK-123", "Run tests associated with FEAT-005").
*   Refer to the `MODE-SPEC-ROO-DISPATCH-001` for the expected input format/content.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Identify the specific rule(s) where `roo-dispatch` delegation occurs.
*   - [ ] Implement logic to extract/prepare the task goal description for the message.
*   - [ ] Implement logic to extract/prepare relevant artifact IDs for the message.
*   - [ ] Implement logic to include the active `project_slug` in the message context.
*   - [ ] Implement formatting of the `new_task` message payload targeting `roo-dispatch`.
*   - [ ] Implement the execution of the `new_task` command.
*   - [ ] Implement handling/logging of the returned `new_task` ID.
*   - [ ] Add comments to the rule files explaining the delegation logic.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying the `new_task` message format for `roo-dispatch`.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying the `new_task` command execution targeting `roo-dispatch`.

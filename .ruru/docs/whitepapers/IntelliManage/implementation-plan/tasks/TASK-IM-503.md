# Task: Create KB directory and populate initial KB content for roo-dispatch

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Create the Knowledge Base (KB) directory structure for the `roo-dispatch` mode (`.ruru/modes/roo-dispatch/kb/`) and populate the initial set of Markdown files (`.md`) based on the structure and content outlines defined in `KB-OUTLINE-ROO-DISPATCH-001`.

This involves writing the detailed procedures, guidelines, and reference information (especially regarding specialist selection and delegation messaging) that the `roo-dispatch` mode will use to guide its own behavior according to the specified rules and best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The directory `.ruru/modes/roo-dispatch/kb/` exists.
*   - [ ] All Markdown files outlined in `KB-OUTLINE-ROO-DISPATCH-001` are created within the directory (`README.md`, `00-kb-usage-strategy.md`, `01-specialist-selection.md`, `02-context-extraction.md`, `03-delegation-messaging.md`).
*   - [ ] Each KB file contains initial content covering the topics specified in the outline.
*   - [ ] Content accurately reflects the procedures and logic defined in `RULES-ROO-DISPATCH-001` and `MODE-SPEC-ROO-DISPATCH-001`.
*   - [ ] `01-specialist-selection.md` details the logic for analyzing tasks and consulting context (Stack Profile, mode summaries) to choose specialists.
*   - [ ] `02-context-extraction.md` provides clear guidelines on reading artifacts and minimizing context for delegation.
*   - [ ] `03-delegation-messaging.md` includes templates and examples for `new_task` messages to specialists.
*   - [ ] Content is written clearly and concisely, suitable for an AI agent to parse and understand.
*   - [ ] Formatting (Markdown) is correct and consistent across files.
*   - [ ] Placeholders for future details or refinements are noted where necessary.
*   - [ ] The KB files are added to version control (Git).

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This task involves translating the outlines and rule specifications into detailed procedural text within Markdown files.
*   Focus heavily on `01-specialist-selection.md` as this contains complex decision logic. Provide concrete examples.
*   In `03-delegation-messaging.md`, create clear templates that `roo-dispatch` can adapt when sending `new_task` commands.
*   Write from the perspective of instructing the `roo-dispatch` mode itself.
*   Ensure consistency in terminology with other specification documents.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Create the directory `.ruru/modes/roo-dispatch/kb/`.
*   - [ ] Create and populate `README.md` (KB overview and index).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `00-kb-usage-strategy.md` (standard usage strategy).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `01-specialist-selection.md` (detailed selection logic, context usage, examples).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `02-context-extraction.md` (guidelines for reading artifacts, minimizing context).
*   - [ ] Create and populate `03-delegation-messaging.md` (message templates, examples for `new_task`).
*   - [ ] Review content for clarity, accuracy, and consistency with specifications.
*   - [ ] Add the new KB files to Git staging.

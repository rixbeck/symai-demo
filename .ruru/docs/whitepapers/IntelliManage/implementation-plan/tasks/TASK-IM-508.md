# Task: Implement result aggregation and final reporting logic (to `session-manager`)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the final step in the `roo-dispatch` workflow: aggregating the results from all delegated specialist tasks (`TASK-IM-507`) and reporting the overall outcome of the originally assigned task back to the requesting coordinator (`session-manager`) using the `attempt_completion` tool/command.

This involves:
1.  Determining the final status (Success, Failure, Blocked) of the overall task based on the outcomes of the individual sub-tasks monitored in `TASK-IM-507`.
2.  Consolidating relevant details, such as paths to modified files (on success) or specific error messages/blocker descriptions (on failure/blockage).
3.  Formatting the final status report message according to the expected format for `session-manager`.
4.  Executing the `attempt_completion` command, targeting the original task ID assigned by `session-manager` when it first delegated to `roo-dispatch`.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Rule(s) exist within `roo-dispatch` that are triggered when all delegated sub-tasks are complete or a critical failure occurs.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly determine the overall task status (Success only if all required steps succeeded).
*   - [ ] The rule(s) aggregate relevant output details (e.g., list of modified files from successful specialist completions).
*   - [ ] The rule(s) aggregate relevant error/blocker details if any sub-task failed or reported blockage.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly format the final status message for `attempt_completion`.
*   - [ ] The rule(s) correctly execute the `attempt_completion` command, providing the final status and aggregated details.
*   - [ ] The `attempt_completion` command correctly targets the original task context initiated by `session-manager`.
*   - [ ] Unit tests (or rule tests) verify the correct aggregation and reporting logic for successful task completion.
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify the correct aggregation and reporting logic for failed task completion.
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify the correct aggregation and reporting logic for blocked task completion.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This logic represents the exit point for a `roo-dispatch` execution cycle.
*   The final status reported should reflect the overall success/failure of the task assigned by `session-manager`. If any critical step failed, the overall status should likely be Failure or Blocked.
*   The message accompanying `attempt_completion` should be concise but informative for `session-manager`. Include key outputs like file paths or the specific reason for failure/blockage.
*   Requires correct usage of the `attempt_completion` tool, ensuring it signals the completion of the task `roo-dispatch` itself was assigned.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Identify/Create the specific rule file(s) for final reporting.
*   - [ ] Implement logic to determine the overall task status based on sub-task outcomes.
*   - [ ] Implement logic to aggregate success details (e.g., file paths).
*   - [ ] Implement logic to aggregate failure/blocker details.
*   - [ ] Implement formatting of the `attempt_completion` message payload.
*   - [ ] Implement the execution of the `attempt_completion` command targeting the original task context.
*   - [ ] Add comments to rules explaining the result aggregation and reporting logic.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying reporting for overall success scenarios.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying reporting for overall failure scenarios.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying reporting for overall blocked scenarios.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying the content of the reported message.

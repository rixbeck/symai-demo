# Task: Implement Integration Layer base structure and interface with CLE

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Establish the foundational code structure for the **Integration Layer**, the component responsible for mediating communication between the IntelliManage Core Logic Engine (CLE) and external systems like GitHub and Git.

This involves:
1.  Defining the main class, module, or set of functions for the Integration Layer.
2.  Defining the interfaces or methods the CLE will use to trigger actions in external systems (e.g., `createGitHubIssue`, `updateGitHubLabels`, `syncProject`).
3.  Defining the interfaces or mechanisms the Integration Layer will use to notify the CLE about events originating from external systems (e.g., `processGitHubWebhook`, `processGitCommit`).
4.  Setting up the basic structure to handle configuration (e.g., reading GitHub repo details, PAT env var name from project config via CLE) and authentication.

This task focuses on the *structure and interface definition*, not the full implementation of sync logic or API calls (which are covered in subsequent tasks).

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A dedicated module/class/directory exists for the Integration Layer code.
*   - [ ] Interfaces/method signatures are defined for CLE -> Integration Layer actions (e.g., `syncArtifactToGitHub(artifactData, config)`, `triggerFullSync(projectSlug)`).
*   - [ ] Interfaces/mechanisms are defined for Integration Layer -> CLE notifications (e.g., `CLE.handleExternalUpdate(updateData)`, event emitter pattern).
*   - [ ] Interfaces/method signatures are defined for Git event processing (e.g., `processCommitMessage(message, repoInfo)`).
*   - [ ] The structure includes placeholders or points for integrating the GitHub API client (`TASK-IM-702`).
*   - [ ] The structure includes logic or placeholders for reading integration settings from project config (via CLE `getProjectConfig`).
*   - [ ] Basic error handling structure for integration operations is defined.
*   - [ ] Code adheres to project coding standards and architectural principles.
*   - [ ] Placeholder implementations or stubs exist for the defined interfaces/methods.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Decide on the architectural pattern (e.g., separate modules for GitHub, Git; a central Integration Manager class).
*   Consider how asynchronous operations (API calls, event handling) will be managed.
*   Define clear data structures for passing information between CLE and Integration Layer (e.g., artifact data, sync status, external event details).
*   The mechanism for IL -> CLE notifications needs careful design (direct calls, event bus, message queue). Direct calls might be simplest initially.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Choose the primary architectural pattern for the Integration Layer.
*   - [ ] Create the main file(s) and directory structure for the Integration Layer.
*   - [ ] Define interface(s) for CLE to trigger GitHub sync actions.
*   - [ ] Define interface(s)/mechanism for Integration Layer to notify CLE of external updates.
*   - [ ] Define interface(s) for processing Git commit messages.
*   - [ ] Add placeholders for GitHub API client integration.
*   - [ ] Implement basic logic to fetch integration config via CLE.
*   - [ ] Define custom error types for Integration Layer operations (e.g., `SyncError`, `ApiError`, `AuthError`).
*   - [ ] Implement basic stubs/placeholder logic for defined methods.
*   - [ ] Add initial documentation (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings) for the Integration Layer interface.

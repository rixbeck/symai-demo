# Task: Integrate GitHub API client and implement secure PAT authentication

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Integrate a suitable GitHub API client library into the Integration Layer (`TASK-IM-701`) and implement the logic to securely authenticate requests using GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) stored in environment variables, as specified in `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001`.

This involves:
1.  Selecting and adding a GitHub API client library (e.g., `@octokit/rest` for Node.js, `PyGithub` for Python) as a project dependency.
2.  Implementing logic within the Integration Layer to:
    *   Read the configured environment variable name (e.g., `GITHUB_PAT`) for the PAT from the project configuration (retrieved via CLE).
    *   Read the actual PAT value from the specified environment variable at runtime.
    *   Instantiate and configure the GitHub API client with the retrieved PAT for authentication.
3.  Handling errors related to missing environment variables or invalid tokens.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A standard GitHub API client library is added as a project dependency.
*   - [ ] Integration Layer logic reads the `pat_env_var_name` setting from the project's GitHub integration configuration.
*   - [ ] Integration Layer logic securely reads the PAT value from the environment variable specified by `pat_env_var_name`.
*   - [ ] The GitHub API client instance is correctly initialized and authenticated using the retrieved PAT.
*   - [ ] An error is logged and handled appropriately if the specified environment variable is not set or is empty.
*   - [ ] An error is logged and handled appropriately if the PAT appears invalid during initial client setup or first API call (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
*   - [ ] The PAT value itself is **never** logged or stored in configuration files.
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify the logic for reading the environment variable name from config.
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify the logic for reading the PAT from the environment variable (using mock environment variables).
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify correct initialization of the mock API client with the token.
*   - [ ] Unit tests verify error handling for missing environment variables.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Library Choice:** Choose a well-maintained and widely used GitHub API client library for your language. `@octokit/rest` is the official JavaScript client.
*   **Security:** Emphasize reading the PAT from environment variables. This is standard practice to avoid committing sensitive tokens to version control. Document clearly for the user where they need to set this variable.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages if the PAT setup fails (e.g., "Environment variable 'GITHUB_PAT' not set. Please configure GitHub integration correctly.").
*   **Client Instantiation:** The API client might be instantiated once per project sync or maintained as part of the Integration Layer's state, depending on the architecture. Ensure authentication details are correctly applied for each project's context if handling multiple projects simultaneously.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Research and select appropriate GitHub API client library.
*   - [ ] Add the library as a project dependency.
*   - [ ] Implement logic within Integration Layer to read `pat_env_var_name` from config (via CLE).
*   - [ ] Implement logic to read the PAT value from the specified environment variable.
*   - [ ] Implement logic to instantiate and authenticate the GitHub API client instance.
*   - [ ] Implement error handling for missing/empty environment variable.
*   - [ ] Implement basic error handling for potential authentication failures during client setup.
*   - [ ] Add comments explaining the authentication flow and security considerations.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for reading config and environment variable (using mocks).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for API client initialization (mocking the client itself).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests for error handling scenarios.

# Task: Implement basic error handling and logging for sync operations

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement basic error handling and logging mechanisms within the GitHub Integration Layer for synchronization operations (Issue, Label, Milestone sync; commit processing).

This involves:
1.  Wrapping GitHub API calls (`TASK-IM-702` client) in try-catch blocks or equivalent error handling structures.
2.  Identifying common GitHub API errors (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 422 Unprocessable Entity, 429 Rate Limit Exceeded, 5xx Server Errors).
3.  Logging informative messages for both successful sync actions and failures.
4.  Propagating critical errors appropriately (e.g., back to the calling function, potentially notifying the user via the coordinator).
5.  Handling specific errors gracefully where possible (e.g., ignoring a 422 error when trying to create a label/milestone that already exists due to a race condition).

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] GitHub API calls made by the sync logic (`TASK-IM-703`, `TASK-IM-704`, `TASK-IM-706`, `TASK-IM-705`, `TASK-IM-707`) are wrapped in error handling blocks.
*   - [ ] Common HTTP error codes (401, 403, 404, 422, 429, 5xx) returned by the GitHub API are specifically checked and handled.
*   - [ ] A logging mechanism (e.g., using a standard logging library or simple console logs initially) is integrated into the Integration Layer.
*   - [ ] Informative log messages are generated for:
    *   - [ ] Start and end of sync operations.
    *   - [ ] Successful creation/update/deletion of GitHub items.
    *   - [ ] Specific API errors encountered (including status code and message).
    *   - [ ] Authentication failures (`TASK-IM-702`).
    *   - [ ] Configuration errors (e.g., missing repo name).
    *   - [ ] Conflict resolution actions taken (`TASK-IM-708`).
*   - [ ] Critical errors (e.g., authentication failure, persistent API errors) are propagated back to the caller or trigger user notification via the coordinator.
*   - [ ] Non-critical errors (e.g., race condition on label creation) are logged but may allow the sync process to continue where appropriate.
*   - [ ] Unit/Integration tests verify that API errors are caught and logged correctly.
*   - [ ] Unit/Integration tests verify that specific errors (e.g., 404 Not Found during an update) are handled appropriately.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Logging:** Choose a logging strategy. Simple console logging might suffice initially, but consider using a structured logging library for easier parsing later. Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) should be used appropriately.
*   **Error Types:** Define custom error types within the Integration Layer (`TASK-IM-701`) to represent specific sync failures (e.g., `GitHubApiError`, `GitHubAuthError`, `SyncConflictError`).
*   **API Client Errors:** The chosen GitHub API client library likely throws specific exceptions or provides error details on failed responses. Inspect these to implement targeted handling.
*   **Rate Limiting (429):** Implement basic retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors. Log warnings when rate limits are hit.
*   **User Notification:** Decide which errors warrant notifying the user directly (via the coordinator) versus just logging for debugging. Authentication failures are usually critical. Transient API errors might just be logged unless persistent.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Choose and integrate a logging mechanism/library.
*   - [ ] Add try-catch/error handling around GitHub API calls in Issue sync logic (`TASK-IM-703`).
*   - [ ] Add try-catch/error handling around GitHub API calls in Label sync logic (`TASK-IM-704`, `TASK-IM-705`).
*   - [ ] Add try-catch/error handling around GitHub API calls in Milestone sync logic (`TASK-IM-706`, `TASK-IM-707`).
*   - [ ] Implement specific handling for common HTTP error codes (401, 403, 404, 422, 429, 5xx).
*   - [ ] Implement logging for successful sync actions (INFO level).
*   - [ ] Implement logging for warnings (e.g., missing optional config, non-critical errors).
*   - [ ] Implement logging for critical errors (ERROR level).
*   - [ ] Implement error propagation mechanism (e.g., throwing custom errors).
*   - [ ] Implement basic retry logic for rate limiting errors (429).
*   - [ ] Add comments explaining error handling and logging strategy.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying logging output for success cases.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying error handling and logging for different API error codes.
*   - [ ] Write tests verifying retry logic for rate limiting (if implemented).

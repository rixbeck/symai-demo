# Task: (Future) Design specifications for UI panels (Explorer, Board)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Design the detailed specifications and mockups for potential future Graphical User Interface (GUI) panels within the IDE (e.g., VS Code side panels) to visualize and interact with IntelliManage data. This task focuses on the design for:

1.  **Project Explorer Panel:** A tree view mirroring the `.ruru/projects/` structure, allowing users to browse Initiatives, Epics, Features, and Tasks visually.
2.  **Kanban Board Panel:** A visual, interactive Kanban board displaying Tasks/Stories/Bugs as cards within columns representing their status.

This is a **design task** focused on defining the user experience, layout, interactions, and data requirements for these UI components. Implementation (`TASK-IM-810`) would follow based on these specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   **Project Explorer Panel Design:**
    *   - [ ] Wireframes or mockups exist showing the layout of the tree view.
    *   - [ ] Specification defines how projects, Initiatives, Epics, Features, and Tasks are displayed hierarchically.
    *   - [ ] Specification defines what information is shown for each item in the tree (e.g., ID, Title, Status icon).
    *   - [ ] Specification defines interactions (e.g., expanding/collapsing nodes, clicking an item to view details - potentially opening the `.md` file or a custom view).
    *   - [ ] Specification defines potential actions (e.g., right-click context menu for create/delete/update status).
    *   - [ ] Specification defines filtering or search capabilities within the explorer.
    *   - [ ] Specification defines data requirements (what data needs to be fetched from CLE to populate the view).
*   **Kanban Board Panel Design:**
    *   - [ ] Wireframes or mockups exist showing the layout of the board view.
    *   - [ ] Specification defines how status columns are generated (based on standard or custom statuses from config).
    *   - [ ] Specification defines the appearance of task cards (showing ID, Title, Type icon, Assignee, Priority).
    *   - [ ] Specification defines interactions:
        *   - [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality to change task status.
        *   - [ ] Clicking a card to view details.
        *   - [ ] Filtering options (by assignee, tag, epic, feature, etc.).
        *   - [ ] Swimlane options (grouping by Epic, Feature, Assignee).
    *   - [ ] Specification defines how WIP limits (if configured) are visualized on column headers.
    *   - [ ] Specification defines data requirements (what data needs to be fetched from CLE to populate the board).
*   **General:**
    *   - [ ] Designs consider integration with the IDE's theme and UX patterns (e.g., VS Code).
    *   - [ ] Designs consider responsiveness and performance implications.
    *   - [ ] Design documentation is clear and sufficient for implementation.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Technology:** Consider the capabilities and limitations of the target IDE extension framework (e.g., VS Code Webview API).
*   **Data Fetching:** Define how the UI panels will efficiently fetch and update data from the CLE without impacting performance. Real-time updates vs. manual refresh.
*   **Interaction with Commands:** How do UI actions (like drag-and-drop) translate into backend operations (e.g., calling `CLE.updateArtifact`)?
*   **User Experience:** Focus on creating an intuitive and efficient visual interface that complements the chat-based interaction.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

    *   - [ ] Document data requirements for Explorer.
*   **Kanban Board:**
    *   - [ ] Research IDE capabilities for board/webview views.

    *   - [ ] Define card appearance and content.
    *   - [ ] Define drag-and-drop interaction specification.
    *   - [ ] Define filtering and swimlane specifications.
    *   - [ ] Define WIP limit visualization.

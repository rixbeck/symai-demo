# Task: (Future) Implement UI panels (Explorer, Board)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement the graphical user interface (GUI) panels for IntelliManage within the target IDE (e.g., VS Code), based on the design specifications created in `TASK-IM-809`. This involves building the frontend components for:

1.  **Project Explorer Panel:** A tree view for browsing IntelliManage artifacts.
2.  **Kanban Board Panel:** A visual Kanban board for managing task status.

This task covers the frontend development, data fetching logic from the Core Logic Engine (CLE), and handling user interactions within these panels to trigger corresponding backend actions.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   **Project Explorer Panel Implementation:**
    *   - [ ] A new panel/view is added to the IDE displaying the IntelliManage Project Explorer.
    *   - [ ] The panel correctly fetches data via the CLE and displays the project hierarchy (Projects, Initiatives, Epics, Features, Tasks) as specified in the design.
    *   - [ ] Items in the tree view display the correct information (ID, Title, Status icon).
    *   - [ ] Nodes can be expanded and collapsed.
    *   - [ ] Clicking an item performs the specified action (e.g., opens the `.md` file).
    *   - [ ] Implemented context menu actions (if designed) trigger the correct CLE operations.
    *   - [ ] Implemented filtering/search functionality works as designed.
    *   - [ ] The panel updates reasonably efficiently when underlying data changes (define refresh mechanism).
*   **Kanban Board Panel Implementation:**
    *   - [ ] A new panel/view is added to the IDE displaying the IntelliManage Kanban Board.
    *   - [ ] The panel correctly fetches data via the CLE and displays tasks as cards in columns representing their status (standard or custom).
    *   - [ ] Columns are generated correctly based on project configuration.
    *   - [ ] Task cards display the specified information (ID, Title, Type, Assignee, Priority).
    *   - [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality correctly triggers `CLE.updateArtifact` calls to change task status.
    *   - [ ] Clicking a card performs the specified action (e.g., shows details).
    *   - [ ] Implemented filtering and swimlane functionality works as designed.
    *   - [ ] WIP limits (if designed) are displayed correctly.
    *   - [ ] The board updates reasonably efficiently when underlying data changes.
*   **General:**
    *   - [ ] UI components adhere to the design specifications (`TASK-IM-809`) and IDE theme guidelines.
    *   - [ ] Interactions are responsive and performant.
    *   - [ ] Appropriate error handling is implemented for data fetching and actions triggered from the UI.
    *   - [ ] Code adheres to project frontend coding standards.
    *   - [ ] Basic usability testing is performed.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Technology Stack:** Likely involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, utilizing the IDE's extension APIs (e.g., VS Code TreeView API, Webview API). Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) might be used within Webviews.
*   **Data Flow:** Implement efficient communication between the UI panels (running in the extension host or webview) and the backend logic (CLE, running in the extension host). This might involve message passing, custom commands, or a dedicated API layer.
*   **State Management:** Manage UI state effectively, especially for fetched data and user interactions.
*   **Performance:** Be mindful of performance when fetching and rendering potentially large numbers of artifacts. Implement virtualization or pagination if necessary.
*   **Testing:** UI testing can be complex. Focus on testing the data fetching and action-triggering logic, potentially with component tests or end-to-end tests using tools like Playwright if feasible within the extension context.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   **Project Explorer:**
    *   - [ ] Set up IDE extension view/panel for the Explorer.
    *   - [ ] Implement data fetching logic from CLE for the tree structure.
    *   - [ ] Implement TreeView rendering logic based on fetched data.
    *   - [ ] Implement expand/collapse interaction.
    *   - [ ] Implement item click interaction (e.g., open file).
    *   - [ ] Implement context menu actions (triggering CLE calls).
    *   - [ ] Implement filter/search UI and logic.
    *   - [ ] Implement data refresh mechanism.
*   **Kanban Board:**
    *   - [ ] Set up IDE extension view/panel (likely Webview) for the Board.
    *   - [ ] Implement data fetching logic from CLE for tasks.
    *   - [ ] Implement column generation based on status config.
    *   - [ ] Implement card rendering logic.

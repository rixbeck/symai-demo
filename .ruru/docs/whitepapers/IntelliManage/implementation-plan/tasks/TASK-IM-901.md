# Task: Review and finalize Document #1 (DOC-ARCH-001 - Architecture)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-ARCH-001 - IntelliManage: Overall Architecture & Core Principles` document to ensure it accurately reflects the final implemented architecture of the IntelliManage framework v1.0, including the layered coordination model (`session-manager`, `roo-dispatch`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-ARCH-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented codebase and final design decisions.
*   - [ ] The architecture diagram (Mermaid) accurately represents the final components (CLE, AI Engine, IL, Session Manager, Roo Dispatch, etc.) and their primary interactions.
*   - [ ] Descriptions of core principles and components align with the implementation.
*   - [ ] Conceptual data flows are accurate.
*   - [ ] Technology stack information is up-to-date.
*   - [ ] Any significant deviations from the initial draft during implementation are reflected or explained.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the document content against the actual code structure and component interactions.
*   Pay close attention to the interaction diagram and ensure it correctly shows the roles of `session-manager` and `roo-dispatch` relative to the user, CLE, and specialists.
*   Update any placeholder text or "TBD" sections.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Read through `DOC-ARCH-001`.
*   - [ ] Compare architecture diagram with implemented component interactions. Update diagram if needed.
*   - [ ] Review Core Principles section for accuracy.
*   - [ ] Review High-Level Architecture Overview section.
*   - [ ] Review Key Component Details section.
*   - [ ] Review Conceptual Data Flow section.
*   - [ ] Review Conceptual Technology Stack section.
*   - [ ] Review Extensibility & Future Considerations section.
*   - [ ] Make necessary edits for accuracy, clarity, and consistency.
*   - [ ] Perform spell check and grammar check.
*   - [ ] Update document status in TOML frontmatter.
*   - [ ] Commit the finalized document.

# Task: Review and finalize Document #2 (DOC-FS-SPEC-001 - File System)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-FS-SPEC-001 - IntelliManage: File System Structure Specification` document to ensure it accurately reflects the final implemented file system layout and naming conventions used by IntelliManage v1.0. This includes the location within `.ruru/`, the multi-project structure, standard subdirectories, and artifact filename formats. Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-FS-SPEC-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented codebase (`TASK-IM-101`) and actual file structures created by the system.
*   - [ ] The specified root directory (`.ruru/projects/`) is correct.
*   - [ ] The multi-project structure (`[project_slug]/`) is accurately described.
*   - [ ] The standard subdirectories within each project (`initiatives/`, `epics/`, `features/`, `tasks/`, `decisions/`, `reports/`, `planning/`, `context/`) are correctly listed and match implementation.
*   - [ ] The location and purpose of configuration files (`projects_config.toml`, `project_config.toml`) are accurately described.
*   - [ ] The file naming conventions (`TYPE-ID_description.md`, `ADR-NNN_...`, etc.) match the implementation precisely.
*   - [ ] Example structures accurately reflect the final layout.
*   - [ ] Rationale and considerations are still valid.
*   - [ ] Any changes or additions made during implementation (e.g., new directories like `archive/` or `.ruru/sessions/`, `.ruru/context/handovers/`) are documented.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the document content against the actual file structure generated by `!pm init project` and where artifacts/logs/summaries are stored by the implemented logic.
*   Verify subdirectory names and filename formats exactly.
*   Ensure the new directories related to `session-manager` (`.ruru/sessions/`, `.ruru/context/handovers/`) are added to the relevant sections or noted as related structures.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Read through `DOC-FS-SPEC-001`.
*   - [ ] Verify Workspace Root Structure section against implementation.
*   - [ ] Verify Project Directory Structure section, including all subdirectories.
*   - [ ] Verify File Naming Conventions section against implementation.
*   - [ ] Update Example Structure if needed.
*   - [ ] Add notes about Session Manager related directories (`sessions/`, `context/handovers/`).
*   - [ ] Review Rationale and Future Considerations sections.
*   - [ ] Make necessary edits for accuracy, clarity, and consistency.
*   - [ ] Perform spell check and grammar check.
*   - [ ] Update document status in TOML frontmatter.
*   - [ ] Commit the finalized document.

# Task: Review and finalize Document #3 (DOC-SCHEMA-001 - Schemas)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-SCHEMA-001 - IntelliManage: TOML Schema Definitions` document to ensure it accurately and completely reflects the final implemented TOML schemas used for artifact frontmatter and configuration files in IntelliManage v1.0. This includes verifying all fields, data types, required/optional status, and enum values against the validation logic implemented in `TASK-IM-103`. Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-SCHEMA-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented schema definitions (`TASK-IM-103`) and validation logic (`TASK-IM-111`).
*   - [ ] General TOML conventions described are accurate.
*   - [ ] Standard Enum values listed (`status`, `priority`, `type`) match the final implementation and validation rules.
*   - [ ] The schema definition for **Initiative** TOML frontmatter is accurate (all fields, types, required/optional).
*   - [ ] The schema definition for **Epic** TOML frontmatter is accurate.
*   - [ ] The schema definition for **Feature** TOML frontmatter is accurate.
*   - [ ] The schema definition for **Task/Story/Bug** TOML frontmatter is accurate (including fields like `sprint_id`, `related_commits`, `related_prs`, `related_issues`).
*   - [ ] The schema definition for **`projects_config.toml`** is accurate.
*   - [ ] The schema definition for **`project_config.toml`** is accurate (including `methodology`, `custom_statuses`, `wip_limits`, `sprints`, `github_integration` table and all its fields).
*   - [ ] The description of Milestone representation (via fields in Epic/Feature) is accurate.
*   - [ ] Any fields added or modified during implementation are correctly documented.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires careful comparison between the specification document and the actual code implementing the schemas (e.g., Zod/Pydantic definitions, validation functions).
*   Verify every field listed for each schema: Is it present? Is the type correct? Is it required or optional as documented? Are enum values correct?
*   Pay special attention to complex nested structures like the `github_integration` table or the `sprints` table in `project_config.toml`.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Read through `DOC-SCHEMA-001`.
*   - [ ] Verify General TOML Conventions and Standard Enum Values sections.
*   - [ ] Verify Initiative Schema against implementation (`TASK-IM-103`/`TASK-IM-105`).
*   - [ ] Verify Epic Schema against implementation (`TASK-IM-103`/`TASK-IM-106`).
*   - [ ] Verify Feature Schema against implementation (`TASK-IM-103`/`TASK-IM-107`).
*   - [ ] Verify Task/Story/Bug Schema against implementation (`TASK-IM-103`/`TASK-IM-108`/`TASK-IM-203`/`TASK-IM-710`).
*   - [ ] Verify `projects_config.toml` Schema against implementation (`TASK-IM-103`/`TASK-IM-110`).
*   - [ ] Verify `project_config.toml` Schema against implementation (covering all sections: base, methodology, sprints, wip, github - `TASK-IM-103`/`TASK-IM-110`/`TASK-IM-204`/`TASK-IM-702` etc.).
*   - [ ] Verify Milestone Representation section.
*   - [ ] Make necessary edits for accuracy, clarity, and consistency. Add any missing fields.
*   - [ ] Perform spell check and grammar check.
*   - [ ] Update document status in TOML frontmatter.
*   - [ ] Commit the finalized document.

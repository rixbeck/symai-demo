# Task: Review and finalize Document #4 (DOC-FUNC-SPEC-001 - CRUD/Linking)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-FUNC-SPEC-001 - IntelliManage: Core Functionality Specification (CRUD & Linking)` document to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented logic within the Core Logic Engine (CLE) for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and linking IntelliManage artifacts. This includes verifying the described processes, inputs, outputs, validation steps, and error handling against the implemented code (`TASK-IM-105` through `TASK-IM-109`, `TASK-IM-113`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-FUNC-SPEC-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented CLE codebase.
*   - [ ] Core Principles (Atomicity, Validation, Traceability, Consistency) accurately reflect the implemented approach.
*   - [ ] CRUD operation descriptions for **Initiatives** match the implementation (`TASK-IM-105`).
*   - [ ] CRUD operation descriptions for **Epics** match the implementation (`TASK-IM-106`).
*   - [ ] CRUD operation descriptions for **Features** match the implementation (`TASK-IM-107`), including `epic_id` handling.
*   - [ ] CRUD operation descriptions for **Tasks/Stories/Bugs** match the implementation (`TASK-IM-108`), including `feature_id` and `type` handling.
*   - [ ] The Hierarchical Linking Mechanism description accurately reflects how parent IDs (`initiative_id`, `epic_id`, `feature_id`) and dependency IDs (`depends_on`) are managed in the code.
*   - [ ] The Subtask Management description accurately reflects how Markdown checklists are manipulated (`TASK-IM-109`).
*   - [ ] The Validation and Data Integrity section accurately describes the checks performed by the CLE (Schema, Status Transitions - `TASK-IM-202`, Link Existence - if implemented).
*   - [ ] The AI Interaction section accurately describes how the AI Engine interfaces with the CLE for CRUD/linking (aligns with `TASK-IM-301`).
*   - [ ] The Error Handling section lists the types of errors the CLE actually throws/returns.
*   - [ ] Any significant deviations or implementation details discovered during development are documented.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the documented procedures step-by-step against the relevant CLE code sections.
*   Verify inputs, outputs, validation checks, file operations, and error handling described in the document match the code's behavior.
*   Ensure the description of how links are established and maintained is precise.
*   Confirm the subtask manipulation logic description matches the implemented Markdown parsing/editing approach.

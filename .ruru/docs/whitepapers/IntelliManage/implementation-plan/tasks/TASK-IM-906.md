# Task: Review and finalize Document #6 (DOC-AI-SPEC-001 - AI Integration)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-AI-SPEC-001 - IntelliManage: AI Integration Specification` document to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented role, capabilities, architecture, and interaction patterns of the AI Engine within IntelliManage v1.0. Verify alignment with the implemented AI capabilities (`TASK-IM-302` to `TASK-IM-307`) and interfaces (`TASK-IM-301`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-AI-SPEC-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented AI Engine codebase and its interactions with CLE/Coordinators.
*   - [ ] Core Principles of AI Integration accurately reflect the final approach.
*   - [ ] AI Engine Architecture & Interactions diagram and description are accurate.
*   - [ ] The description of **Artifact Generation & Enhancement** capability matches implementation (`TASK-IM-302`).
*   - [ ] The description of **Automated Linking** capability matches implementation (`TASK-IM-303`).
*   - [ ] The description of **Status Tracking & Inference** capability matches implementation (`TASK-IM-304`), including the suggestion-confirmation flow.
*   - [ ] The description of **Reporting & Visualization** capability matches implementation (`TASK-IM-305`), including methodology awareness (`TASK-IM-308`).
*   - [ ] The description of **Guidance & Refinement** capability matches implementation (`TASK-IM-306`).
*   - [ ] The description of **Natural Language Interaction** capability matches implementation (`TASK-IM-307`).
*   - [ ] The description of **Learning & Adaptation** (primarily via config reading) matches implementation.
*   - [ ] The described **Interaction Patterns** (AI->LLM, AI->CLE, AI->User) are accurate.
*   - [ ] **Data Requirements** listed are correct.
*   - [ ] **Configuration & Customization** notes are accurate.
*   - [ ] **AI-Specific Error Handling** section reflects implemented error handling.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the documented capabilities and interactions against the actual AI Engine code, including LLM prompts used, data parsing logic, and calls to/from CLE and coordinators.
*   Ensure the distinction between AI *suggestion* and final *action* (requiring confirmation or CLE execution) is clear throughout the document, especially for status updates.
*   Verify that the interfaces described match the final implementation from `TASK-IM-301`.

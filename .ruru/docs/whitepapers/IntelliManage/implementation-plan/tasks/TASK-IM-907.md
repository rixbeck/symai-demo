# Task: Review and finalize Document #7 (DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001 - GitHub Integration)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001 - IntelliManage: GitHub Integration Specification` document to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented logic for integrating IntelliManage with GitHub. Verify alignment with the implemented configuration options, mapping logic, synchronization flows, commit scanning, authentication, and error handling (`TASK-IM-701` through `TASK-IM-713`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-GITHUB-SPEC-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented Integration Layer codebase.
*   - [ ] Core Principles accurately reflect the final approach.
*   - [ ] Architecture & Interaction diagram/description is accurate.
*   - [ ] Configuration section (`project_config.toml` details) matches the implemented settings and defaults (`TASK-IM-712`, `TASK-IM-705`, `TASK-IM-707`, `TASK-IM-708`).
*   - [ ] **Synchronization Logic:**
    *   - [ ] Issue <-> Task/Story/Bug sync description matches implementation (`TASK-IM-703`).
    *   - [ ] Label <-> Metadata sync description matches implementation (`TASK-IM-704`).
    *   - [ ] Milestone <-> Epic/Feature sync description matches implementation (`TASK-IM-706`).
    *   - [ ] Commit/PR Linking description matches implementation (`TASK-IM-709`, `TASK-IM-710`).
    *   - [ ] Optional auto-creation logic for labels/milestones description matches implementation (`TASK-IM-705`, `TASK-IM-707`).
*   - [ ] Conflict Resolution Strategy description matches the implemented logic (`TASK-IM-708`).
*   - [ ] Authentication section accurately describes the PAT/environment variable method used (`TASK-IM-702`).
*   - [ ] AI Assistance section aligns with implemented AI capabilities related to GitHub sync.
*   - [ ] Error Handling section reflects the actual errors handled and logged (`TASK-IM-713`).
*   - [ ] Limitations & Considerations section is updated based on implementation experience.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the documented sync logic, configuration handling, and error reporting against the Integration Layer code.
*   Verify the exact mapping rules used for labels and milestones.
*   Confirm the conflict resolution strategy implemented matches the documentation.
*   Ensure the commit scanning keywords and linking behavior are accurately described.

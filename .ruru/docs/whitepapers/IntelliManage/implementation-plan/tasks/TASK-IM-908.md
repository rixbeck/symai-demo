# Task: Review and finalize Document #8 (DOC-UI-CMD-SPEC-001 - Commands/UI)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DOC-UI-CMD-SPEC-001 - IntelliManage: User Interaction & Command Specification` document to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented command structure (`!pm` syntax), available commands, options, and primary interaction patterns for IntelliManage v1.0. Verify alignment with the implemented command parser (`TASK-IM-802`), router (`TASK-IM-803`), help functionality (`TASK-IM-804`), and standard message formats (`TASK-IM-805`, `TASK-IM-806`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-UI-CMD-SPEC-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented command handling logic.
*   - [ ] Core Interaction Principles accurately reflect the final user experience.
*   - [ ] Primary Interaction Method (Chat Interface, `!pm` prefix) description is accurate (`TASK-IM-801`).
*   - [ ] Command Syntax Overview accurately describes the final parsing rules (`TASK-IM-802`).
*   - [ ] **Detailed Command Specification:**
    *   - [ ] All implemented `!pm` verbs are listed.
    *   - [ ] The syntax (arguments, options) shown for each verb matches the implementation.
    *   - [ ] Required vs. optional arguments/options are correctly documented for each command.
    *   - [ ] Descriptions accurately reflect what each command does.
    *   - [ ] Example usage for each command is correct and helpful.
    *   - [ ] Commands covered: `set-active`, `init project`, `config`, `create`, `show`, `list`, `update`, `delete`/`archive`, `link`, `unlink`, `report`, `sync`, `status`, `help`.
*   - [ ] AI Interaction & Confirmation section accurately describes how NL input is handled (`TASK-IM-807`) and when confirmations are required.
*   - [ ] UI Elements section accurately reflects the status (Future) of UI panels (`TASK-IM-809`, `TASK-IM-810`).
*   - [ ] Error Handling & Feedback section aligns with the standardized error messages (`TASK-IM-806`).
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires testing each `!pm` command as implemented and comparing its behavior (required args, accepted options, output format) against the documentation.
*   Verify the examples provided in the document actually work as described.
*   Ensure consistency between the command spec and the `!pm help` output (`TASK-IM-804`).

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

# Task: Write and finalize Document #9 (DOC-SETUP-GUIDE-001 - Setup Guide)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Write, review, and finalize the user-facing `DOC-SETUP-GUIDE-001 - IntelliManage: Setup & Configuration Guide`. This document should provide clear, step-by-step instructions for end-users to initialize IntelliManage in their workspace, configure single or multiple projects, set methodologies, and optionally set up GitHub integration.

This involves taking the initial draft (`TASK-IM-909` depends on the *existence* of the draft, this task is about *finalizing* it) and ensuring it is accurate, complete, easy to follow, and reflects the final implemented commands and configuration options.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DOC-SETUP-GUIDE-001` document exists and is finalized.
*   - [ ] Prerequisites listed are accurate and complete.
*   - [ ] Instructions for initial workspace setup (automatic creation of `.ruru/projects/`) are clear and correct.
*   - [ ] Instructions for configuring the first project using `!pm init project` are accurate, including examples for `--name` and `--methodology`.
*   - [ ] Instructions for configuring multiple projects are clear.
*   - [ ] Instructions for optionally configuring `projects_config.toml` are included.
*   - [ ] Instructions for setting the active project context (`!pm set-active`) are clear.
*   - [ ] Instructions for customizing project methodology (`!pm config project --set methodology=...`) are accurate.
*   - [ ] Instructions for defining custom statuses, WIP limits, and sprints via `!pm config project` are included and correct (reflecting final TOML structure).
*   - [ ] Instructions for configuring GitHub integration (`!pm config project --set github_integration...`) are accurate, complete, and emphasize secure PAT handling via environment variables.
*   - [ ] Troubleshooting section addresses common setup issues.
*   - [ ] All example commands in the guide work correctly with the final implementation.
*   - [ ] The guide is easy for a new user to follow.
*   - [ ] Formatting (Markdown), grammar, and clarity are checked and finalized.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Target Audience:** Write for end-users (developers, project managers) who may not be familiar with the internal architecture.
*   **Clarity:** Use simple language, clear steps, and accurate command examples.
*   **Verification:** Manually walk through the setup steps described in the guide using the final IntelliManage implementation to ensure accuracy.
*   **Screenshots (Optional):** Consider adding screenshots of the expected directory structure or command outputs if helpful.
*   **GitHub PAT Security:** Strongly emphasize the importance of using environment variables for PATs and not putting tokens in config files. Link to GitHub documentation on creating PATs with correct scopes.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

# Task: Review and finalize Document #12 (MODE-SPEC-ROO-DISPATCH-001 - Mode Spec: roo-dispatch)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `MODE-SPEC-ROO-DISPATCH-001 - Mode Specification: roo-dispatch` document (the `.mode.md` file created in `TASK-IM-501`) to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented behavior, capabilities, configuration, and documentation of the `roo-dispatch` mode. Verify alignment with the implemented rules (`TASK-IM-502`), KB (`TASK-IM-503`), and core logic (`TASK-IM-504` through `TASK-IM-508`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections directly within the `.mode.md` file. Mark the document status within its frontmatter as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `roo-dispatch.mode.md` file has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented mode's rules, KB, and observed behavior.
*   - [ ] **TOML Frontmatter:**
    *   - [ ] `id`, `name`, `version` are correct.
    *   - [ ] `classification`, `domain`, `sub_domain` accurately reflect the mode's role (lightweight task execution coordinator).
    *   - [ ] `summary` is concise and accurate.
    *   - [ ] `system_prompt` accurately describes the final key responsibilities (receive task, retrieve context, select specialist, delegate, monitor, report outcome) and operational guidelines (stateless, efficient).
    *   - [ ] `allowed_tool_groups` correctly lists the tools actually used by the implemented rules (read, new_task, complete, potentially list_files/ask).
    *   - [ ] `file_access` section accurately reflects the directories/files the implemented rules read from (artifacts, stack profile, mode summary) or write to (internal logs only).
    *   - [ ] `metadata` section (tags, categories, delegate_to, escalate_to, reports_to, documentation_urls) is accurate and complete, linking to other finalized docs.
    *   - [ ] `custom_instructions_dir` points to the correct KB location.
*   - [ ] **Markdown Documentation:**
    *   - [ ] Description, Capabilities, Workflow & Usage Examples, Limitations, and Rationale sections accurately reflect the final implementation.
    *   - [ ] Workflow examples accurately depict the interaction flow (Receive -> Context -> Select -> Delegate -> Monitor -> Report).
*   - [ ] Formatting (TOML and Markdown), grammar, and clarity are checked and improved within the `.mode.md` file.
*   - [ ] The document status (within the TOML frontmatter, if using such a field) is updated.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This task involves editing the `roo-dispatch.mode.md` file directly.
*   Requires careful comparison of the specification text (especially system prompt, capabilities) against the implemented rules (`.roo` files) and KB content (`.md` files).
*   Verify the specialist selection logic described aligns with the implemented algorithm (`TASK-IM-505`).
*   Ensure the description of context retrieval (`TASK-IM-504`) and delegation messaging (`TASK-IM-506`) is accurate.
*   Confirm the stateless nature is correctly emphasized.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Read through `roo-dispatch.mode.md`.
*   - [ ] Verify all TOML frontmatter fields against implementation and other specs.
    *   - [ ] Check System Prompt details.
    *   - [ ] Check Tool Access.
    *   - [ ] Check File Access.
    *   - [ ] Check Metadata (delegates, escalations, doc links).
*   - [ ] Verify Markdown Description section.
*   - [ ] Verify Markdown Capabilities section against implemented features.
*   - [ ] Verify Markdown Workflow & Usage Examples section against rules.
*   - [ ] Verify Markdown Limitations section (especially statelessness).
*   - [ ] Verify Markdown Rationale section.
*   - [ ] Make necessary edits directly in the `.mode.md` file for accuracy, clarity, and consistency.
*   - [ ] Perform spell check and grammar check within the file.
*   - [ ] Update document status in TOML frontmatter (if applicable).
*   - [ ] Commit the finalized `.mode.md` file.

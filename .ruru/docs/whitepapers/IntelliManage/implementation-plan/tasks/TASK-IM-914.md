# Task: Review and finalize Document #14 (DATA-FORMAT-HANDOVER-001 - Data Format: Handover)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `DATA-FORMAT-HANDOVER-001 - IntelliManage: Handover Summary Data Format` document to ensure it accurately describes the final structure, content sections, and placeholders used in the handover summary Markdown files. Verify alignment with the actual template file (`.ruru/templates/handover_summary_template.md`) and the information being populated by the `agent-session-summarizer` (`TASK-IM-605`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `DATA-FORMAT-HANDOVER-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented template and summarizer logic.
*   - [ ] File Location and Naming Convention sections are accurate.
*   - [ ] File Format description (Markdown, no TOML) is accurate.
*   - [ ] **Content Structure and Sections:**
    *   - [ ] All sections listed (Header, Goal, Last Actions, Active Tasks, Next Steps, Links, Blockers, Conclusion) match the final template structure.
    *   - [ ] The description of content expected in each section is accurate.
    *   - [ ] The placeholders listed (e.g., `{{TIMESTAMP}}`, `{{CURRENT_GOAL}}`, `{{ACTIVE_TASK_X_ID}}`) exactly match those used in the template file and populated by the summarizer agent.
*   - [ ] The Example Handover Summary File accurately reflects the final format and content types.
*   - [ ] Generation and Consumption section correctly identifies the generator (`agent-session-summarizer`) and consumer (`session-manager`).
*   - [ ] Considerations section provides relevant advice.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires direct comparison between the document, the template file (`.ruru/templates/handover_summary_template.md`), and the output generated by the summarizer agent (`TASK-IM-605`, `TASK-IM-608`).
*   Ensure every placeholder mentioned in the document exists in the template and vice-versa.
*   Verify the example summary accurately reflects the structure and typical content.

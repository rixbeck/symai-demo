# Task: Review and finalize Document #15 (RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001 - Rules: session-manager)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001 - Rules Specification: session-manager` document to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented operational rules and procedures governing the `session-manager` mode. Verify alignment with the implemented Roo rule files (`.roo` files created in `TASK-IM-402`) and the mode's observed behavior during testing (`TASK-IM-412`, `TASK-IM-413`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented `.roo` rule files for `session-manager`.
*   - [ ] Core Objective & Role description is accurate.
*   - [ ] Session Start / Resumption Procedure description matches the implemented rule logic (`TASK-IM-404`).
*   - [ ] Active Project Context Management description matches the implemented rule logic (`TASK-IM-410`).
*   - [ ] User Request Handling & Delegation description accurately reflects the parsing and routing implemented (`TASK-IM-406`), including calls to CLE, `roo-dispatch` (`TASK-IM-407`), and `agent-session-summarizer` (`TASK-IM-408`).
*   - [ ] Session Logging Procedure description matches the implemented logging rules and format (`TASK-IM-409`).
*   - [ ] Error Handling & Escalation description matches the implemented error handling and escalation rules (`TASK-IM-411`).
*   - [ ] Interaction Style description reflects the mode's actual behavior.
*   - [ ] Any significant deviations or refinements made during rule implementation are documented.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the documented procedures step-by-step against the actual `.roo` rule files.
*   Verify the tool usage described (e.g., `list_files`, `read_file`, `ask_followup_question`, `new_task`, `edit` tools) matches the implementation.
*   Ensure the described logic flow (conditionals, loops if any) accurately represents the rules.
*   Confirm that the delegation messages and error handling procedures match the code.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Read through `RULES-SESSION-MANAGER-001`.
*   - [ ] Verify Core Objective & Role section.
*   - [ ] Verify Session Start / Resumption Procedure against rules code.
*   - [ ] Verify Active Project Context Management against rules code.
*   - [ ] Verify User Request Handling & Delegation against rules code (parsing, routing, specific delegations).
*   - [ ] Verify Session Logging Procedure against rules code.
*   - [ ] Verify Error Handling & Escalation against rules code.
*   - [ ] Verify Interaction Style section.
*   - [ ] Make necessary edits for accuracy, clarity, and consistency with implemented rules.
*   - [ ] Perform spell check and grammar check.
*   - [ ] Update document status in TOML frontmatter.
*   - [ ] Commit the finalized document.

# Task: Review and finalize Document #16 (RULES-ROO-DISPATCH-001 - Rules: roo-dispatch)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `RULES-ROO-DISPATCH-001 - Rules Specification: roo-dispatch` document to ensure it accurately describes the final implemented operational rules and procedures governing the `roo-dispatch` mode. Verify alignment with the implemented Roo rule files (`.roo` files created in `TASK-IM-502`) and the mode's observed behavior during testing (`TASK-IM-509`, `TASK-IM-510`). Make necessary updates, clarifications, and corrections. Mark the document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `RULES-ROO-DISPATCH-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the implemented `.roo` rule files for `roo-dispatch`.
*   - [ ] Core Objective & Role description (lightweight, stateless coordinator) is accurate.
*   - [ ] Task Intake and Context Retrieval procedure description matches the implemented rule logic (`TASK-IM-504`), including CLE calls.
*   - [ ] Specialist Selection procedure description accurately reflects the implemented algorithm (`TASK-IM-505`), including use of Stack Profile and mode summaries.
*   - [ ] Task Delegation to Specialists procedure description matches the implemented context preparation and `new_task` logic (`TASK-IM-506`).
*   - [ ] Monitoring and Result Aggregation description matches the implemented handling of `attempt_completion` from specialists (`TASK-IM-507`).
*   - [ ] Reporting Outcome to Requester procedure description matches the implemented final `attempt_completion` logic (`TASK-IM-508`).
*   - [ ] Error Handling description accurately reflects how specialist errors are reported upwards.
*   - [ ] Interaction Style description (functional, non-interactive) reflects the mode's actual behavior.
*   - [ ] Any significant deviations or refinements made during rule implementation are documented.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   Requires comparing the documented procedures step-by-step against the actual `.roo` rule files for `roo-dispatch`.
*   Verify the tool usage described (e.g., `read_file`, `new_task`, `complete`) matches the implementation.
*   Ensure the specialist selection logic description aligns with the implemented algorithm.
*   Confirm the stateless nature of the implementation is reflected in the procedures.

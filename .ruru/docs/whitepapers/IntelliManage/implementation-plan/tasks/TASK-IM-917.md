# Task: Review and finalize Document #17 (KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001 - KB Outline: session-manager)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing `KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001 - KB Outline: session-manager` document to ensure it accurately reflects the final structure and content topics of the implemented Knowledge Base (KB) for the `session-manager` mode (located at `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/` and populated in `TASK-IM-403`).

Verify that all planned KB files exist, their filenames are correct, and the outlined content topics accurately represent the information contained within those files. Make necessary updates to the outline document to match the final KB structure. Mark the outline document as finalized or published upon completion.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001` document has been thoroughly reviewed against the actual KB files created in `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/`.
*   - [ ] The KB Directory Structure shown in the outline matches the actual directory structure.
*   - [ ] All KB files listed in the outline (`README.md`, `00-...md`, `01-...md`, etc.) exist in the KB directory with the correct filenames.
*   - [ ] The brief description of the content for each KB file listed in the outline accurately reflects the main topics covered in the corresponding implemented `.md` file.
*   - [ ] Any KB files added or removed during implementation are reflected in the outline.
*   - [ ] Formatting, grammar, and clarity of the outline document itself are checked and improved.
*   - [ ] The document status is updated (e.g., from `draft` to `published` or `final`) in its metadata.
*   - [ ] Changes are committed to version control.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   This task focuses on ensuring the *outline document* is accurate, acting as a correct table of contents for the actual KB. It does not involve reviewing the full content of each KB file (though that's implicitly part of ensuring the outline descriptions are correct).
*   Requires comparing the list and descriptions in `KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001` against the filenames and content themes in the `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/` directory.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Read through `KB-OUTLINE-SESSION-MANAGER-001`.
*   - [ ] List the actual files present in `.ruru/modes/session-manager/kb/`.
*   - [ ] Compare the documented KB Directory Structure in the outline against the actual structure.
*   - [ ] Compare the list of KB files in the outline against the actual files. Add/remove/rename entries in the outline as needed.
*   - [ ] For each file listed in the outline, briefly review the corresponding `.md` file's content to ensure the outline's description is accurate. Update descriptions in the outline if needed.
*   - [ ] Make necessary edits to the outline document for accuracy and consistency.
*   - [ ] Perform spell check and grammar check on the outline document.
*   - [ ] Update document status in TOML frontmatter.
*   - [ ] Commit the finalized outline document.

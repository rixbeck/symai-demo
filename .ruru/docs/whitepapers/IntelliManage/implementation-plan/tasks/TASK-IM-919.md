# Task: Review and enhance unit test coverage for CLE

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing unit tests for the Core Logic Engine (CLE), covering schema validation (`TASK-IM-111`), CRUD operations (`TASK-IM-112`), linking logic (`TASK-IM-113`), and status transition validation (`TASK-IM-206`). Use code coverage tools to identify gaps in test coverage. Enhance the test suite by adding new tests to cover untested code paths, edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values, ensuring the CLE's core functionality is robust and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Code coverage reports are generated for the CLE modules/functions.
*   - [ ] Test coverage percentage for CLE logic meets or exceeds the defined project standard (e.g., 80% line/branch coverage).
*   - [ ] Gaps identified by the coverage report are analyzed.
*   - [ ] New unit tests are added to cover previously untested logic branches within CLE methods (CRUD, linking, validation, config loading, status transitions).
*   - [ ] New unit tests are added to cover edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, maximum values, unusual characters in titles/descriptions if relevant).
*   - [ ] New unit tests are added to cover specific error handling paths within the CLE.
*   - [ ] Existing tests are reviewed and refactored for clarity and effectiveness if necessary.
*   - [ ] All unit tests for the CLE pass consistently.
*   - [ ] The enhanced test suite is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Coverage Tools:** Utilize the code coverage reporting tools integrated with the project's testing framework (e.g., Jest coverage, `pytest-cov`, Go `cover`).
*   **Analysis:** Focus on covering `if/else` branches, `switch` cases, loops, and error handling blocks (`try/catch`) that were missed in the initial tests.
*   **Edge Cases:** Think about potential problematic inputs: empty strings, null values (where allowed), very long strings, special characters, non-existent IDs passed to update/delete, etc.
*   **Mocking:** Continue to use mocking effectively for dependencies (file system, validation module) to keep tests focused on CLE logic.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Configure and run code coverage reporting for CLE tests.
*   - [ ] Analyze coverage report to identify untested files, functions, and code branches.
*   - [ ] Prioritize testing critical or complex logic paths with low coverage.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in CRUD logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in linking logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in schema validation logic (if separate from schema definition tests).
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in status transition validation logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in config loading logic.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests specifically targeting edge cases for inputs.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests specifically targeting error handling paths.
*   - [ ] Refactor existing tests for clarity or better coverage if needed.
*   - [ ] Rerun coverage report and verify improvement meets target.
*   - [ ] Ensure all CLE unit tests pass.
*   - [ ] Commit the enhanced test suite.

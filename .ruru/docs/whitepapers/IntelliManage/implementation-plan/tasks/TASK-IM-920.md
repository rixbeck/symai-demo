# Task: Review and enhance unit test coverage for AI Engine utilities

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Review the existing unit tests for the AI Engine's core capabilities, including NLP command parsing (`TASK-IM-307`), linking suggestions (`TASK-IM-303`), status inference (`TASK-IM-304`), basic reporting (`TASK-IM-305`), and guidance generation (`TASK-IM-306`). Use code coverage tools to identify gaps in test coverage for the internal logic of these features (excluding the external LLM calls themselves, which should be mocked). Enhance the test suite by adding new tests to cover untested logic paths, edge cases, and error handling scenarios related to parsing inputs, processing data, interacting with mocks (CLE, LLM), and formatting outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] Code coverage reports are generated for the AI Engine modules/functions implementing core capabilities.
*   - [ ] Test coverage percentage for AI Engine utility logic meets or exceeds the defined project standard.
*   - [ ] Gaps identified by the coverage report are analyzed.
*   - [ ] New unit tests are added to cover previously untested logic branches within:
    *   - [ ] NLP command parsing (handling different NL variations, entity extraction edge cases).
    *   - [ ] Linking suggestion (keyword analysis variations, filtering logic edge cases).
    *   - [ ] Status inference (commit/chat parsing variations, keyword mapping edge cases).
    *   - [ ] Reporting generation (handling different data sets from mock CLE, formatting edge cases).
    *   - [ ] Guidance generation (handling different artifact content inputs).
*   - [ ] New unit tests cover specific error handling paths (e.g., handling failed CLE calls, malformed LLM responses from mocks).
*   - [ ] Existing tests are reviewed and refactored for clarity and effectiveness if necessary.
*   - [ ] All unit tests for the AI Engine utilities pass consistently.
*   - [ ] The enhanced test suite is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Implementation Notes / Details üìù

*   **Coverage Tools:** Use the project's standard coverage reporting tools.
*   **Mocking:** Heavy reliance on mocking CLE interfaces and LLM API responses is expected. Ensure mocks cover a variety of successful and unsuccessful scenarios.
*   **Focus:** Test the *internal logic* of the AI Engine: how it processes input data, how it interacts with mocks based on that data, how it formats output, and how it handles internal errors or errors from mocked dependencies. Do *not* test the LLM's actual intelligence.
*   **Analysis:** Look for untested conditional branches, helper functions, data transformation logic, and error handling blocks.

## Subtasks / Checklist ‚òëÔ∏è

*   - [ ] Configure and run code coverage reporting for AI Engine tests.
*   - [ ] Analyze coverage report to identify untested logic.
*   - [ ] Prioritize testing critical or complex logic paths with low coverage.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in NLP parsing logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in linking suggestion logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in status inference logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in reporting logic.
*   - [ ] Write new unit tests for uncovered branches in guidance logic.
*   - [ ] Write unit tests specifically targeting error handling paths (mocked CLE/LLM failures).
*   - [ ] Write unit tests targeting edge cases for input data processing.
*   - [ ] Refactor existing tests for clarity or better coverage if needed.
*   - [ ] Rerun coverage report and verify improvement meets target.
*   - [ ] Ensure all AI Engine unit tests pass.
*   - [ ] Commit the enhanced test suite.

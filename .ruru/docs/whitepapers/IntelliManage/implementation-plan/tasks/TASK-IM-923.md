# Task: Create initial project `README.md` for IntelliManage implementation itself

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Create the main `README.md` file at the root of the IntelliManage implementation project repository. This file serves as the primary entry point for developers, contributors, and potentially users wanting to understand the project.

The initial README should include:
1.  Project Title (IntelliManage).
2.  A brief description of the project's purpose and goals (solving integrated PM in AI dev environments).
3.  Mention of the core concepts (layered coordination, file-based artifacts, AI integration).
4.  Current status of the project (e.g., Under Development, Alpha, Beta, Released).
5.  Links to key documentation (e.g., the main White Paper, Architecture, Setup Guide, Usage Guide).
6.  Instructions for setting up the development environment (if applicable for contributors).
7.  Basic usage examples (how to invoke core commands).
8.  Information on how to contribute (if applicable).
9.  License information.

# Roo Commander: Enhanced Git Integration - Overview & Rationale

## 1. Problem Statement

Currently, Git is used primarily for basic version control operations (add, commit, push). The rich contextual information within the repository's history (commit messages, branches, tags, authorship) is largely untapped by the AI modes. This limits traceability, context gathering for existing code, and the ability to automate more sophisticated workflows involving versioning and releases.

## 2. Goal

To enhance the Roo Commander system by integrating Git more deeply, transforming the Git repository from a simple version history into a queryable **knowledge base** for both AI modes and human users. This involves:

*   Standardizing Git practices (commits, branches, tags).
*   Enabling AI modes to extract contextual information from Git history.
*   Automating Git operations within workflows where appropriate (e.g., branching for features, tagging releases).

## 3. Proposed Solution Summary

This initiative involves several interconnected changes:

1.  **Standardized Git Practices:** Define and enforce standards for detailed commit messages (including task linking), branch naming conventions, and release tagging.
2.  **Enhanced `dev-git`:** Ensure `dev-git` can execute a wider range of Git commands reliably (`log`, `show`, `blame`, `tag`, `branch`) and format commits according to the new standard.
3.  **Contextual Git Lookups:** Enable modes like `agent-context-resolver` and specialists to query Git history (`git log`, `git show`, `git blame`) via `execute_command` to understand code provenance and change rationale.
4.  **Workflow Integration:** Incorporate automated Git actions into standard workflows:
    *   **Task Branching:** Optionally create branches automatically when starting significant MDTM tasks.
    *   **Release Tagging:** Automatically tag releases during the build/deployment process.
5.  **Rule & Prompt Updates:** Modify mode rules and prompts to reflect and enforce these new standards and capabilities.

## 4. Benefits

*   **Enhanced Traceability:** Directly link code changes to MDTM tasks via commit messages.
*   **Richer Context:** Provide AI modes with historical context ("Why was this code written this way?") by analyzing commit messages and blame history.
*   **Improved Debugging:** Faster identification of when and why changes were introduced (`git blame`, `git log`).
*   **Streamlined Releases:** Consistent tagging simplifies release management.
*   **Better Collaboration:** Standardized practices improve clarity for human developers.
*   **Foundation for Automation:** Enables more sophisticated workflow automation involving version control.

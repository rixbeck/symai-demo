# Plan: AI-Driven Mode Knowledge Base Enrichment

This plan outlines the workflow for taking structured documentation data (output from the initial `create_kb_from_json.js` process) and using AI to create higher-level synthesized context documents, which are then organized and indexed within the knowledge base (`kb/`) of specific target modes (e.g., `framework-astro`).

**Phases:**

1.  **Source Preparation:** Ensure the library documentation has been initially processed into structured markdown files grouped by page/topic (output of the existing KB generation workflow).
    *   **Details:** See `.ruru/planning/kb-enrichment/01-source-preparation.md`

2.  **AI Synthesis:** Use a dedicated AI mode (e.g., `agent-context-condenser`) to read the prepared source files and generate *new*, synthesized documents (e.g., core concepts, API overviews, common patterns).
    *   **Details:** See `.ruru/planning/kb-enrichment/02-ai-synthesis.md`

3.  **KB Organization & Indexing:** Store the synthesized documents in the target mode's specific KB directory and create TOML-based index files for discoverability by the mode.
    *   **Details:** See `.ruru/planning/kb-enrichment/03-kb-organization-indexing.md`

4.  **Mode Integration:** Update the target specialist mode's configuration/prompts to leverage its newly enriched knowledge base.
    *   **Details:** See `.ruru/planning/kb-enrichment/04-mode-integration.md`

**Execution:** Roo Commander will coordinate the execution of steps outlined in each phase document, delegating synthesis tasks to AI specialists and file/index manipulation potentially to `prime-coordinator` or other utility modes if direct interaction proves too complex.

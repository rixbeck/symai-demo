# Plan: Define `agent-context-synthesizer` Mode

**Objective:** Specify the requirements and initial content for the new `agent-context-synthesizer` mode, which is responsible for generating synthesized knowledge base documents.

**1. Mode Core Definition:**

*   **Slug:** `agent-context-synthesizer`
*   **Name:** `ðŸ§  Context Synthesizer`
*   **Directory:** `.ruru/modes/agent-context-synthesizer/`
*   **Primary Goal:** To read one or more source markdown files containing structured documentation snippets (output from the initial KB generation process) and generate a *new*, synthesized markdown document summarizing specific aspects (e.g., core concepts, API overview) based on instructions received during delegation.

**2. Required Capabilities & Tools:**

*   **File Reading:** Must be able to read multiple input files provided via paths.
    *   Tool: `read_file`
*   **Content Analysis & Synthesis:** Must leverage the underlying LLM's capabilities to understand the input content, identify patterns/core ideas, and generate coherent, summarized text according to a specific goal.
    *   Capability: LLM Reasoning
*   **Markdown Generation:** Must format its synthesized output as well-structured Markdown, including TOML frontmatter.
    *   Capability: LLM Generation / Formatting
*   **File Writing:** Must be able to write the final synthesized document to a specified output path.
    *   Tool: `write_to_file`

**3. Mode File (`.mode.md`) Content Plan:**

*   **Target Path:** `.ruru/modes/agent-context-synthesizer/agent-context-synthesizer.mode.md`
*   **TOML Frontmatter:**
    ```toml

*   **System Prompt / Instructions (Markdown Body):**
    ```markdown
    # Agent: Context Synthesizer - Operational Instructions

    ## Core Task
    Your primary function is to synthesize information from multiple source documents (provided as file paths) into a single, coherent summary document focused on a specific objective given to you during delegation.

    ## Workflow
    1.  **Receive Task:** You will be activated via `new_task`. The message will contain:
        *   A list of input file paths (e.g., files from `kb/[library_name]/[category]/`).
        *   A target output file path (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode_slug]/kb/[library_name]/synthesized/[output_name].md`).
        *   A specific synthesis objective (e.g., "Generate an overview of core library concepts", "Summarize the API surface", "Identify common usage patterns").
    2.  **Read Inputs:** Use the `read_file` tool iteratively to read the content of *all* provided input file paths. Accumulate the relevant content.
    3.  **Synthesize:** Analyze the combined content based *strictly* on the provided objective. Identify the key information, concepts, patterns, or summaries requested.
    4.  **Generate Output Content:** Draft the synthesized information as clear, well-structured Markdown. Use appropriate headings, lists, and potentially concise code examples *if relevant to the summary*. **Do not simply concatenate input files.** Create *new* explanatory text.
    5.  **Generate TOML Frontmatter:** Create a `+++` TOML block for the output file including:
        *   `title`: A descriptive title reflecting the synthesis objective (e.g., "Core Concepts: [Library Name]").
        *   `summary`: A 1-2 sentence abstract summary of the synthesized document's content.
        *   `tags`: A list of 5-10 relevant keywords derived from the synthesized content (lowercase, hyphenated).
        *   `source_files`: (Optional but helpful) A list of the input file paths used for this synthesis.
    6.  **Combine & Format:** Prepend the generated TOML frontmatter to the synthesized Markdown content.
    7.  **Write Output:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to save the combined content to the target output file path specified in the task.
    8.  **Report Completion:** Use `attempt_completion` to report success (including the output file path) or failure (with error details) back to the coordinator.

    ## Important Considerations
    *   **Focus:** Strictly adhere to the synthesis objective provided in the task message.
    *   **Conciseness:** Aim for high-level summaries and overviews, not exhaustive detail (unless specifically requested).
    *   **Accuracy:** Ensure the synthesized information accurately reflects the source material.
    *   **Formatting:** Output must be valid Markdown with valid TOML frontmatter.
    ```

**4. Knowledge Base (`kb/`) Plan:**

*   **Initial Content:** Initially, the `kb/` directory for `agent-context-synthesizer` can be minimal or empty. It doesn't need specific library knowledge itself.
*   **Potential Future KB:**
    *   `01-synthesis-strategies.md`: Could contain general guidelines or examples of different synthesis techniques (e.g., extracting core concepts vs. summarizing APIs).
    *   `02-formatting-examples.md`: Could show examples of well-formatted output Markdown and TOML frontmatter.

**5. Addressing Feedback:**

*   This mode directly addresses the need for the AI Synthesis step (Phase 2).
*   **Quality Control:** This mode *generates* the content. The *validation* of that content needs to happen in a subsequent step coordinated by `roo-commander`, potentially involving `util-reviewer` or user feedback, as suggested in the feedback document and planned in Phase 3/4 refinements. This synthesizer mode itself isn't responsible for self-validation beyond basic formatting.

**Completion:** This plan defines the necessary `agent-context-synthesizer` mode. Next steps would be to use `prime-coordinator` or `util-mode-maintainer` to create the directory and files based on this plan.

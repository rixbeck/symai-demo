# Strategy Overview: AI-Driven Mode Knowledge Base Enrichment

## 1. Overview / Purpose üéØ

Roo specialist modes require accurate and relevant context about the technologies they work with to perform effectively. While external documentation exists, accessing and processing it in real-time can be inefficient. Furthermore, raw documentation often lacks the high-level summaries, conceptual overviews, and pattern identification that are most useful for AI reasoning.

This document outlines the strategy for creating and maintaining enriched, internal Knowledge Bases (KBs) for specialist modes by leveraging AI synthesis. The goal is to transform detailed, structured source documentation into concise, targeted context documents optimized for AI consumption, thereby improving mode performance, consistency, and reliability.

## 2. Core Strategy üß≠

The strategy employs a multi-phase pipeline coordinated by `roo-commander`:

1.  **Source Preparation:** Ensure the target library's documentation exists in a structured Markdown format, typically generated by initial processing scripts (e.g., `create_kb_from_json.js`). This forms the raw input for synthesis.
2.  **AI Synthesis (Customizable):** Utilize a dedicated AI agent (`agent-context-synthesizer`) to process the prepared source files. Crucially, this phase uses **customizable task sets** defined in TOML files, selected based on the library's type (e.g., UI framework, backend API). This allows for generating tailored synthesized documents (e.g., core concepts, API overviews, common patterns) relevant to that specific technology domain.
3.  **KB Organization & Indexing:** Store the newly synthesized Markdown documents (including their own TOML frontmatter) within the target mode's dedicated KB directory (`.ruru/modes/[mode_slug]/kb/[library_name]/synthesized/`). Generate robust, queryable **TOML-based index files** (`index.toml`) at both the library level and the mode's master KB level to make the synthesized content discoverable.
4.  **Mode Integration:** Update the target specialist mode's configuration (`.mode.md`) to be aware of its KB structure. Provide the mode with an internal KB document (`00-kb-usage-strategy.md`) detailing how to query the indexes and prioritize using the synthesized internal knowledge before resorting to external sources.

## 3. Key Components üß©

This strategy relies on several interconnected components:

*   **Structured Source Data:** Markdown files derived from original documentation, organized by category (e.g., `kb/[library_name]/guide/`).
*   **Library Type Mapping:** A central JSON file (`scripts/library-types.json`) mapping library names to standardized types (e.g., `frontend-framework`, `ai-sdk`).
*   **Synthesis Task Sets:** TOML files (`.ruru/templates/synthesis-task-sets/`) defining specific synthesis goals (description, inputs, output filename, prompt focus) for each library type.
*   **Synthesizer Agent:** The `agent-context-synthesizer` mode, responsible for reading source files and executing synthesis tasks based on delegation instructions.
*   **Synthesized Documents:** AI-generated Markdown files containing high-level summaries, concepts, or patterns, including TOML frontmatter (title, summary, tags). Stored in `.ruru/modes/[mode_slug]/kb/[library_name]/synthesized/`.
*   **KB Index Files:** TOML files (`index.toml`) providing metadata (title, summary, tags, file path) for discoverability of synthesized documents. Located at the library level and the mode's master KB level.
*   **Mode Integration Artifacts:** Updates to the mode's `.mode.md` file and the creation of an internal `00-kb-usage-strategy.md` guide.

## 4. Benefits ‚ú®

*   **Improved Mode Performance:** Provides modes with readily accessible, relevant, and synthesized context, reducing the need for costly real-time external lookups or processing large raw documents.
*   **Tailored Context:** Customizable task sets ensure synthesized content is relevant to the library type and the likely needs of the specialist mode.
*   **Consistency & Reliability:** Standardizes the process for generating and integrating internal knowledge, leading to more predictable mode behavior.
*   **Extensibility:** Easily add support for new libraries by updating the mapping file and potentially creating new task sets. Task sets themselves can be refined over time.
*   **Reduced External Dependencies:** Less reliance on the availability and structure of external documentation during critical task execution.

## 5. Workflow Summary ü™ú

1.  Coordinator identifies the target library and mode.
2.  Coordinator determines the library type using the mapping file.
3.  Coordinator loads the appropriate synthesis task set (TOML) for that type.
4.  Coordinator iterates through the tasks, delegating each synthesis job (with input files, output path, and prompt focus) to `agent-context-synthesizer`.
5.  Coordinator verifies synthesized file creation.
6.  Coordinator scans synthesized files, extracts metadata, and generates/updates the library-specific and mode-master `index.toml` files.
7.  Coordinator delegates updates to the target mode's `.mode.md` file and creation of its `00-kb-usage-strategy.md`.
8.  Coordinator (or QA process) performs verification/testing.

## 6. Quality & Maintenance Considerations üßê

*   **Validation:** The quality of AI-synthesized content is critical. An explicit validation or review step (potentially involving `util-reviewer` or manual checks) should be incorporated after the AI Synthesis phase to ensure accuracy and relevance before integration.
*   **Maintenance:** The Library Type Mapping file (`scripts/library-types.json`) requires ongoing manual updates as new libraries are added to the system. Synthesis Task Sets may also need refinement based on feedback.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Establishing a mechanism for modes or users to provide feedback on the usefulness of the enriched KBs is essential for iterative improvement.

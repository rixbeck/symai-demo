# Java Performance Tuning Overview

Optimizing Java applications for speed, resource usage, and responsiveness.

## Methodologies
*   **Profiling:** Monitoring JVM operations (object creation, methods, threads, GC) to find bottlenecks (hotspots, leaks, contention). Uses sampling or instrumentation.
*   **Benchmarking:** Measuring performance under specific conditions to establish baselines, compare implementations, and track regressions.

## Tools
*   **Java VisualVM:** Bundled (pre-JDK 9) / Standalone tool integrating `jstat`, `jmap`, `jstack`. Monitors CPU, memory, threads; allows heap dump analysis and profiling.
*   **JDK Mission Control (JMC) & Java Flight Recorder (JFR):**
    *   **JFR:** Low-overhead JVM event recording framework.
    *   **JMC:** Tool to analyze JFR recordings.
*   **Third-Party:** JProfiler, YourKit, Async Profiler, IntelliJ Profiler.

## Key Tuning Areas

1.  **Garbage Collection (GC) Tuning:**
    *   **Goal:** Balance latency (pause times), throughput, and footprint.
    *   **GC Logs:** Essential for analysis (`-Xlog:gc*`). Tools like GCEasy help interpretation.
    *   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose based on needs (Serial, Parallel, CMS (removed), G1 (default), ZGC, Shenandoah).
    *   **Heap Sizing:** `-Xms` (initial), `-Xmx` (max). Setting equal avoids resizing pauses. Control Young Gen size (`-Xmn`, `-XX:NewRatio`). Consider `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`.

2.  **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation Analysis:**
    *   **Process:** Interpreter -> JIT Compiler (C1/Client -> C2/Server via Tiered Compilation) for hotspots.
    *   **Analysis:** Observe using `-XX:+PrintCompilation` or profilers to ensure critical code is optimized.
    *   **Tuning:** Options like `-XX:CompileThreshold`, Compiler Controls.

3.  **Code Optimization Techniques:**
    *   **Reduce Object Creation:** Reuse objects, use primitives, avoid temporary objects in loops, use `StringBuilder` over `String` concatenation.
    *   **Efficient Data Structures:** Choose based on access patterns (`ArrayList` vs `LinkedList`, etc.).
    *   **Concurrency Optimization:** Use `java.util.concurrent`, minimize lock scope/contention, consider lock-free approaches.
    *   **Algorithm Choice:** Select algorithms with appropriate time/space complexity.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Premature Optimization:** Optimize only identified bottlenecks.
*   **Ignoring GC:** Leads to unpredictable pauses or errors.
*   **Incorrect Benchmarking:** Leads to flawed conclusions.
*   **Over-Tuning:** Makes configuration brittle.
*   **Memory Leaks:** Logical leaks (unneeded references) require profiler detection.
*   **Ignoring Environment:** Tuning is often environment-specific.

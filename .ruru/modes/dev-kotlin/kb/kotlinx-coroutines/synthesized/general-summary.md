# Kotlinx Coroutines: General Summary

Kotlinx Coroutines is a rich library for Kotlin that provides infrastructure for writing asynchronous, non-blocking code using lightweight units of computation called coroutines. Its primary purpose is to simplify complex asynchronous programming, offering features like structured concurrency to manage coroutine lifecycles robustly and prevent resource leaks. Key features include suspendable functions (`suspend fun`), coroutine builders (`launch`, `async`, `runBlocking`), dispatchers for thread management (`Dispatchers.IO`, `Dispatchers.Main`, etc.), and the powerful `Flow` API for handling asynchronous streams of data. It is widely adopted for managing concurrency effectively in various Kotlin applications, particularly on Android and backend systems.

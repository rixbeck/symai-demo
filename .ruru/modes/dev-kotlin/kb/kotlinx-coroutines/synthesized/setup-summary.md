# Kotlinx Coroutines: Basic Setup Summary

The provided source documentation focuses heavily on the core concepts, usage patterns, error handling, and advanced features (like `Flow`) of `kotlinx.coroutines`. It does not contain explicit steps for basic project setup or installation.

Typically, integrating `kotlinx.coroutines` into a Kotlin project involves adding the necessary library dependency to the project's build configuration file (e.g., `build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle`, or `pom.xml`). The specific artifact required depends on the target platform (e.g., `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm` for JVM, `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android` for Android). Refer to the official Kotlinx Coroutines documentation for the exact dependency coordinates and any platform-specific setup requirements.

# Rust Concurrency

Rust places a strong emphasis on **concurrency** alongside memory safety and performance. Its type system and ownership rules are designed to prevent common concurrency bugs, particularly **data races**, at compile time.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Fearless Concurrency:** Rust's safety guarantees allow developers to write concurrent code with confidence, knowing that many potential issues are caught before runtime.
*   **Ownership and Borrowing:** These core principles extend to concurrent scenarios, ensuring that data accessed by multiple threads is handled safely (e.g., using `Arc` for shared ownership and `Mutex` or `RwLock` for controlled mutation).
*   **Send and Sync Traits:** These marker traits enforce which types can be safely transferred (`Send`) or accessed (`Sync`) across thread boundaries.
*   **Async/Await:** Rust has first-class support for asynchronous programming using `async` and `await`. This allows for efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks without blocking threads.
*   **Ecosystem:** Popular crates like `tokio`, `async-std`, and others provide powerful runtimes and utilities for building complex asynchronous applications.

By leveraging these features, Rust enables the development of highly concurrent and performant applications while maintaining its core promise of safety.

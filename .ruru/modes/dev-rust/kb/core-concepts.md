# Rust Core Concepts

Rust is a statically typed systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Understanding its core concepts is crucial for effective development.

## Static Typing
Rust checks types at compile time, preventing many common errors before runtime. It features strong type inference, meaning you often don't need to explicitly declare types.

## Ownership & Borrowing (The Borrow Checker)
This is Rust's most unique feature, ensuring memory safety without a garbage collector.
*   **Ownership:** Each value has a single *owner*. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
*   **Borrowing:** You can create references (`&T`) or mutable references (`&mut T`) to values owned by others. The borrow checker enforces rules (e.g., only one mutable borrow *or* multiple immutable borrows at a time) at compile time to prevent data races.

## Immutability by Default
Variables declared with `let` are immutable. Use `let mut` to declare mutable variables. This encourages safer code by making mutability explicit.

## Rich Enums & `Option`/`Result`
Enums (enumerations) allow defining a type by enumerating its possible variants.
*   **`Option<T>`:** Represents an optional value (either `Some(T)` or `None`). Used instead of null pointers/references to handle absence explicitly.
*   **`Result<T, E>`:** Represents either success (`Ok(T)`) or failure (`Err(E)`). Used for robust error handling.

## Pattern Matching (`match`, `if let`)
Rust provides powerful pattern matching to destructure data types (like enums and structs) and control program flow based on their structure.
*   **`match`:** Exhaustively checks all possible patterns for a value.
*   **`if let` / `while let`:** A concise way to match a single pattern.

## Traits (Zero-Cost Abstractions)
Traits define shared behavior, similar to interfaces or protocols in other languages. They enable polymorphism and code reuse. Rust's trait system allows for "zero-cost abstractions," meaning these high-level constructs compile down to efficient machine code without runtime overhead.

## Generics
Generics allow writing code that operates on abstract types, which are specified later. This reduces code duplication and increases flexibility (e.g., creating collections like `Vec<T>` that can hold any type `T`).

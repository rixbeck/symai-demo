# Rust: Performance by Design

Rust is designed with performance as a core goal, alongside memory safety and concurrency. It achieves high performance comparable to C and C++ through several mechanisms:

1.  **Memory Safety without Garbage Collection:** Rust's ownership and borrowing system enforces memory safety at compile time, eliminating the need for a runtime garbage collector which can introduce unpredictable pauses and overhead.
2.  **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** Rust provides high-level abstractions like traits (similar to interfaces) and generics that compile down to efficient machine code with minimal or no runtime overhead. This means you can write expressive, high-level code without sacrificing performance. Examples include iterators, futures (for async), and smart pointers.
3.  **Control Over Data Layout:** Rust gives developers fine-grained control over how data is laid out in memory, enabling optimizations crucial for systems programming.
4.  **LLVM Backend:** Rust leverages the mature LLVM compiler infrastructure for powerful backend optimizations.
5.  **Concurrency:** Fearless concurrency allows developers to write efficient parallel code without data races, contributing to overall application performance.

Focusing on these aspects allows the `dev-rust` mode to generate code that is not only safe but also highly performant.

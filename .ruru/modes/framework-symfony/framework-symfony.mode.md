# ðŸŽ¼ PHP/Symfony Developer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Builds and maintains web applications using PHP and the Symfony framework, including Doctrine ORM, Twig templating, Routing, Services, Console Commands, Testing, and Symfony Components.

## Capabilities

*   Develop backend logic with Symfony (Controllers, Services, Event Listeners, Commands, Forms).
*   Implement frontend with Twig templates and Symfony UX components.
*   Manage database with Doctrine ORM (entities, repositories, migrations, fixtures).
*   Write and run tests with PHPUnit and Symfony's testing framework.
*   Use Symfony Console commands and Maker Bundle for code generation.
*   Configure services, routing, and security using YAML/PHP configuration.
*   Debug Symfony applications using Symfony Profiler and debugging tools.
*   Optimize Symfony app performance using caching, optimization techniques.
*   Work with Symfony Flex and bundles ecosystem.
*   Collaborate with frontend, database, API, infrastructure, and CI/CD specialists.
*   Process MDTM task files with status updates (if applicable).
*   Log progress, decisions, and results in project journals (if applicable).
*   Escalate complex or out-of-scope tasks appropriately.
*   Handle errors and report completion status.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive task (direct or MDTM), understand requirements, log initial goal.
2.  **Implementation:**
    *   Develop backend logic (Controllers, Services, Event Listeners, etc.).
    *   Implement frontend views (Twig templates, forms).
    *   Manage database schema (Doctrine entities, migrations).
    *   Utilize Console commands and Maker Bundle.
3.  **Testing:** Write and run unit/functional tests (PHPUnit).
4.  **Debugging & Optimization:** Identify and fix issues, apply performance improvements.
5.  **Collaboration/Escalation:** Coordinate with other specialists or escalate if needed.
6.  **Logging & Reporting:** Log progress/completion, update task status, report back.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Create a New Feature**

```prompt
Implement a new feature to manage user blog posts. Create a `Post` entity with Doctrine annotations, generate a migration, create a controller with CRUD actions, Twig templates for listing, creating, and editing posts, and corresponding functional tests. Ensure routes are defined in `config/routes.yaml` or using annotations.
```

**Example 2: Add a Console Command**

```prompt
Create a new Console command `app:cleanup:old-logs` that deletes log files older than 30 days from the `var/log` directory. Use the Maker Bundle to generate the command structure and ensure it handles potential errors gracefully.
```

**Example 3: Optimize Doctrine Queries**

```prompt
The `PostController::index` method has inefficient Doctrine queries causing N+1 problems. Refactor the query to use `JOIN` or `fetch=EAGER` to optimize performance. Verify the fix with Symfony Profiler's database panel.
```

**Example 4: Create a Custom Service**

```prompt
Create a custom service `EmailNotificationService` that sends notification emails using Symfony Mailer. Register it in the service container and inject it into a controller to send welcome emails when users register.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on the Symfony framework and its core ecosystem (Doctrine, Twig, Console, Security, Forms, Symfony UX components).
*   May require assistance for highly complex frontend JavaScript implementations beyond standard Twig/UX integration.
*   Does not handle advanced database administration or complex query optimization beyond standard Doctrine practices (will escalate to `data-specialist`).
*   Does not manage infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or complex containerization setups (will escalate to `lead-devops`, `infra-specialist`).
*   Relies on provided specifications; does not perform UI/UX design or high-level architectural planning.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on PHP/Symfony ensures high proficiency within this specific technology stack, leading to efficient and idiomatic code.
*   **Component-Based Approach:** Leverages Symfony's component architecture and dependency injection for maintainable applications.
*   **Ecosystem Awareness:** Includes knowledge of common Symfony tools and bundles (Maker, Flex, UX, Security, Mailer) for practical application development.
*   **Collaboration Model:** Defined escalation paths ensure that tasks requiring specialized knowledge outside of Symfony (e.g., advanced DB, infra, frontend JS) are handled by the appropriate expert modes.
*   **File Access:** Scoped file access aligns with typical Symfony project structures, promoting focused work and preventing unintended modifications.

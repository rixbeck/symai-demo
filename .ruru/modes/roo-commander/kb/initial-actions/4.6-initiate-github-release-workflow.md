# KB: Initial Action - Initiate GitHub Release Workflow with Defaults

## 1. Objective üéØ
To start the "Create Roo Commander Build" workflow ([`WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1)) using a set of predefined default parameters for platform, build flags, and GitHub release creation. This will skip the interactive questions for these specific parameters for this initiation path.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Sets default parameters and initiates the target workflow.
*   **User:** Selects option 4.6 from the initial menu.

## 3. Procedure üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Step 1: Acknowledge and Set Default Parameters (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Acknowledge the user's selection and define the default build parameters.
    *   **Inputs:** User selected option 4.6 ("üì¶ Build release on GitHub").
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Internally set the following `build_parameters`:
            *   `platform`: "linux, mac, windows"
            *   `build_flags`: "none"
            *   `create_github_release`: "yes" (boolean true)
            *   Note: The `version` parameter will be determined by a subsequent step within the `WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1` workflow (specifically, [`00b_suggest_next_version.md`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1/00b_suggest_next_version.md)).
    *   **Outputs:** `build_parameters` object ready for workflow input.

*   **Step 2: Initiate Build Workflow with Defaults (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Start the [`WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1) workflow, providing the predefined `build_parameters` as its input.
    *   **Inputs:** `build_parameters` object from Step 1.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Inform the user: "Okay, starting the 'Create Roo Commander Build' workflow with default parameters (Platform: Linux, Mac, Windows; Build Flags: none; Create GitHub Release: yes)."
        2.  Initiate the workflow by processing its entry point ([`.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1/00_start.md`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1/00_start.md)).
        3.  Ensure the `build_parameters` object (containing `platform`, `build_flags`, `create_github_release`) is passed as the `workflow_input` to this workflow.
    *   **Outputs:** The [`WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1) is now active and will proceed with its defined steps.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the workflow ([`.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1/00_start.md`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1/00_start.md)) cannot be found or initiated, report an error to the user and consult `EE_handle_start_error.md` or a general error handling procedure.

## 4. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   The "Create Roo Commander Build" workflow ([`WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1`](./.ruru/workflows/WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1)) has been started.
*   The workflow has received the predefined default parameters for platform, build flags, and GitHub release creation.
*   The user has been informed that the process has started with these defaults.
*   The Coordinator's responsibility for *this specific initial action* is complete, and control is passed to the `WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1` workflow.

## 5. Rationale / Notes ü§î
*   This procedure allows for a streamlined initiation of the build and release process by using sensible defaults, as requested by the user.
*   "Build flags" are parameters that can modify the behavior of a build script. Common examples include `--production`, `--debug`, `--no-cache`, or `--target=specific_architecture`. For this workflow, "none" is a safe default if the user is unsure.

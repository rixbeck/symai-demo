Based on the provided documents, npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, used for managing project dependencies, publishing packages, and running scripts. Key commands include `npm init` to create a `package.json` manifest file, `npm install` to download and manage dependencies listed in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, `npm version` to manage package versions according to SemVer, and `npm publish` to upload packages to the npm registry. The `package.json` file is central, defining metadata, dependencies, and lifecycle scripts which automate tasks at various stages like installation, testing, and publishing.

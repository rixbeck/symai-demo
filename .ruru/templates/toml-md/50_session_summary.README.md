# Template: 50_session_summary.md - Session Summary

## 1. Purpose

This template defines the structure for a **Session Summary** document. Session summaries are generated to provide a concise, actionable overview of a completed or paused user interaction session (`session_log.md`). They are crucial for:

*   **Continuity:** Enabling a developer (human or AI) to quickly understand the context, outcomes, and next steps from a previous session.
*   **Handoff:** Facilitating the transfer of work or knowledge between team members or different AI modes.
*   **Review & Archival:** Providing a digestible record of significant session activities without needing to parse the entire raw session log.
*   **Context for Future Sessions:** Serving as a starting point or reference for new sessions that build upon previous work.

This summary is typically generated by a specialized agent/mode (e.g., `agent-session-summarizer`) by processing an existing `session_log.md` and its associated artifacts.

## 2. TOML Frontmatter Schema

The following TOML fields provide structured metadata for the session summary:

*   `id` (String, Required, Auto-generated Format): Unique identifier for this summary document.
    *   *Format:* `SESSUM-[OriginalSessionID]-[SummaryCreationTimestamp]`
    *   *Example:* `SESSUM-SESSION-UpdateDocs-2401011200-240102143000`
*   `title` (String, Required): Descriptive title for the summary, usually derived from the original session's goal.
    *   *Example:* `"Session Summary: Update Authentication Module Documentation"`

    *   *Example:* `["Schedule review of drafted API documentation.", "Investigate alternative caching libraries."]`
*   `related_summaries` (Array of Strings, Optional): Paths to other relevant session summary files that might provide preceding or related context.
    *   *Example:* `[".ruru/sessions/SESSION-InitialAuthDesign-2312200900/summaries/SESSUM-SESSION-InitialAuthDesign-2312200900-231220173000.md"]`
*   `tags` (Array of Strings, Optional): Keywords for discoverability and categorization of this summary.
    *   *Example:* `["authentication", "api-design", "documentation", "security"]`
*   `primary_context_artifacts` (Array of Tables, Optional): Lists key artifacts from the original session that are important for understanding its context. Each table has:
    *   `path` (String, Required): Relative path to the artifact from the original session's `artifacts/` directory.

*   `relevant_code_areas` (Array of Tables, Optional): Lists key source code files or modules that were significantly worked on or impacted. Each table has:
    *   `path` (String, Required): Path to the code file/module.
        *   *Example:* `"src/modules/auth/services/tokenService.js"`
    *   `change_summary` (String, Required): Brief summary of changes made or relevance.
        *   *Example:* `"Implemented token generation and validation logic."`
*   `summary_reviewed_by` (String, Optional): Mode/User who reviewed this summary.
*   `summary_review_date` (String, Optional, Timestamp): Timestamp of review.
*   `summary_approved` (Boolean, Optional): Indicates if the summary has been approved.

## 4. Usage Guidelines

*   This template should be populated by an automated process or a dedicated summarization agent.
*   The goal is to be concise yet comprehensive enough for effective handoff.
*   Placeholders like `{{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}}` and `{{MODE_SLUG}}` should be replaced by the generating agent.
*   Paths in `primary_context_artifacts` are relative to the *original session's* `artifacts/` directory.
*   This summary document itself would typically be stored in a `summaries/` subdirectory within the original session's directory (e.g., `.ruru/sessions/[OriginalSessionID]/summaries/[SummaryID].md`).

This structured summary aims to significantly improve knowledge transfer and continuity between work sessions.

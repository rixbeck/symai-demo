# Step 99: Finish Workflow

## Actions

(Coordinator `{{delegate_to}}` performs these actions)

1.  **Verify User Approval:** Check that `user_feedback` from the previous step indicates approval. If not, this step should ideally not be reached, but handle as an error if it is.
2.  **Log Completion:** Log the successful completion of the Context7 refresh for mode `{{mode_slug}}` using URL `{{context7_base_url}}`. Include the detail status (`{{detail_status}}`) in the log message. (Follow Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).
3.  **Prepare Final Report:** Construct the `workflow_result` output message confirming success.
    *   Example: "Successfully refreshed Context7 KB for mode `{{mode_slug}}` from source `{{context7_base_url}}`. Source details status: `{{detail_status}}`."
4.  **Report Outcome:** Use `attempt_completion` to report the `workflow_result` back to the User or initiating process.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   User approval was confirmed in the previous step.
*   Successful completion is logged, including mode, URL, and detail status.
*   A final success message (`workflow_result`) is generated and reported.

## Error Handling

*   If user approval is missing or negative (should be caught earlier), treat as an unexpected state and log an error.
*   Errors during logging should be noted but may not prevent reporting success if the core task finished.

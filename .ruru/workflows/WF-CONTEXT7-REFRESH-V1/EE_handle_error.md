# Step EE: Handle Workflow Error

## Actions

(Coordinator `{{delegate_to}}` performs these actions)

1.  **Log Error:** Log the details of the error received in the `error_details` input, including the `failed_step_id`. (Follow Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).
2.  **Prepare Failure Report:** Construct the `workflow_result` output message indicating failure.
    *   Example: "Workflow WF-CONTEXT7-REFRESH-V1 failed at step `{{failed_step_id}}` for mode `{{mode_slug}}`. Error: {{error_details}}."
3.  **Report Failure:** Use `attempt_completion` to report the `workflow_result` (failure) back to the User or initiating process.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The error details are logged.
*   A failure message (`workflow_result`) is generated.
*   Workflow failure is reported via `attempt_completion`.

## Error Handling

*   If logging fails, attempt to report the original error anyway.

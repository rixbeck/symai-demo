# Step 04: Verify Build Artifacts

## Actions

1.  **Receive Context:** Get `collection_build_status` and `raw_artifacts_path` from the previous step (03c).
2.  **Check Prerequisite:** If `collection_build_status` is Failure, immediately skip to the error step (`EE_handle_verify_error.md`).
3.  **List Artifacts:** List the contents of the `raw_artifacts_path` directory.
4.  **Verify Key Files:** Check for the presence of essential expected artifacts (e.g., `roo-commander-*.zip`, `kilocode-*.zip`, collection build outputs). The exact list depends on the build process outputs.
5.  **Basic Integrity Check (Optional):** Perform minimal checks if feasible (e.g., non-zero file size for archives).
6.  **Set Status:** Set `artifacts_verified_status` to Success if all required artifacts are found (and pass optional checks), otherwise Failure.
7.  **Prepare Output:** Provide the `artifacts_verified_status`.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Step proceeds only if `collection_build_status` from the previous step was Success.
*   The `raw_artifacts_path` directory is accessed.
*   Presence of key expected build artifacts is confirmed.
*   `artifacts_verified_status` is set accurately.

## Error Handling

*   If prerequisite `collection_build_status` is Failure, proceed directly to `EE_handle_verify_error.md`.
*   If key artifacts are missing or fail basic checks, set `artifacts_verified_status` to Failure and proceed to `EE_handle_verify_error.md`.

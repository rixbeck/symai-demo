# Step 02: AI Assessment of Context Depth/Breadth

**Responsible Mode:** Coordinator (Roo Commander), potentially delegates

## Procedure

1.  **Prepare Input:**
    *   Coordinator extracts the list of filenames/sources used or generated during **[Step 01](./01_context_gathering.md)**.

2.  **Formulate Query:**
    *   Coordinator formulates a query for an LLM (e.g., via `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `answer_query_direct` or internal capability).
    *   **Example Query:** "Based on these source filenames related to [Mode Purpose/Topic]: [List of filenames]. Assess the likely depth and breadth of the knowledge base that could be generated. Provide a rating (e.g., Basic, Standard, Comprehensive, Advanced) and list the key topics likely covered."
    *   *(Note: Replace `[Mode Purpose/Topic]` and `[List of filenames]` with actual values from previous steps.)*

3.  **Execute Query & Store Result:**
    *   Coordinator (or a delegated agent) executes the query using the chosen LLM tool (prefer MCP).
    *   Coordinator stores the resulting rating (e.g., "Comprehensive") and the list of key topics. This result will be used in **[Step 05](./05_kb_prompt.md)**.

4.  **Proceed:** Upon successful completion (or handling failure as per error handling), proceed to the next step: **[03_context_synthesis.md](./03_context_synthesis.md)**.

## Error Handling
*   If the AI assessment query fails:
    *   Log the error.
    *   Default the assessment rating to 'Standard'.
    *   Set the key topics list to empty or a generic placeholder.
    *   Notify the User of the assessment failure and the default rating being used.
    *   Proceed with the workflow.

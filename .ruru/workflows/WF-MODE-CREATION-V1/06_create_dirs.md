# Step 06: Delegate Directory Creation

**Responsible Mode:** Coordinator (Roo Commander) delegates to **Mode Structure Agent** (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `technical-writer`, `toml-specialist`)

## Procedure

1.  **Delegate Task:**
    *   Coordinator instructs the Mode Structure Agent to create the necessary directory structure for the new mode.

2.  **Instructions for Mode Structure Agent:**
    *   The instructions provided by the Coordinator **MUST** specify the exact directories to create, using the `<new-slug>` confirmed in **[Step 00](./00_start.md)**:
        *   Mode directory: `.ruru/modes/<new-slug>/`
        *   KB subdirectory: `.ruru/modes/<new-slug>/kb/`
        *   Rules directory: `.roo/rules-<slug>/` (using the confirmed lowercase `kebab-case` `<new-slug>`)
    *   Instructions should specify the preference for using MCP tools and the requirement to handle fallbacks:
        *   **Tool Preference:**
            *   Prefer MCP `vertex-ai-mcp-server` tool: `create_directory`.
            *   Fallback: Standard `execute_command` tool with `mkdir -p ...`.
    *   The agent should attempt to create all directories and report success or failure for each.

3.  **Await Completion:**
    *   Coordinator awaits the completion signal and status report from the Mode Structure Agent.

4.  **Proceed:** Upon successful creation of all directories, proceed to the next step: **[07_create_mode_file.md](./07_create_mode_file.md)**.

## Error Handling
*   If the Mode Structure Agent fails to create any of the required directories using both preferred and fallback methods:
    *   Log the specific error(s).
    *   Attempt to retry the delegation for the failed directories.
    *   Check the status of relevant MCP tools and `execute_command` functionality.
    *   If failure persists, notify the User and consider manual intervention or abandoning the workflow.

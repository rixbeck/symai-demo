# Step 09: Delegate KB Content / Instruction File Creation

**Responsible Mode:** Coordinator (Roo Commander) delegates to **Mode Structure Agent** (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `technical-writer`, `toml-specialist`)

## Procedure

1.  **Retrieve User Decision:**
    *   Coordinator retrieves the User's decision regarding KB population and structure (Populate/Basic/Skip, Single Folder/Subfolders) made in **[Step 05](./05_kb_prompt.md)**.

2.  **Delegate Task (Conditional):**
    *   Based on the User's decision:
        *   **If "Standard KB (Single Folder)" or "Comprehensive KB (Subfolders)":**
            1.  Instruct the Agent to **read and parse the JSON context** from `.ruru/temp/mode-creation-context-<new-slug>.json` (Prefer MCP `read_file_content`, fallback `read_file`).
            2.  Instruct the Agent to **iterate through the JSON array**. For each item:
                *   Determine the target path:
                    *   **If "Standard KB (Single Folder)" was chosen:** The path is `.ruru/modes/<new-slug>/kb/{item.filename}`.
                    *   **If "Comprehensive KB (Subfolders)" was chosen:**
                        *   The Agent must **determine the appropriate subfolder** within `.ruru/modes/<new-slug>/kb/` based on the `item.filename` and potentially the AI-assessed topics (from Step 02). (e.g., map `installation.md` to `setup/`, `usage.md` to `usage/`). *[Agent logic required here]*
                        *   The Agent must **create the subfolder** if it doesn't exist (Prefer MCP `create_directory`, fallback `execute_command mkdir -p ...`).
                        *   The path is `.ruru/modes/<new-slug>/kb/{subfolder}/{item.filename}`.
                *   Create/populate the KB file at the determined target path using the `item.content`. Process iteratively for many files. (Prefer MCP `write_file_content`, fallback `write_to_file`).
        *   **If "Basic KB Structure":**
            1.  Instruct the Agent to create placeholder files or a single file (e.g., `_placeholder.md` or `README.md` with a note) in `.ruru/modes/<new-slug>/kb/` indicating basic structure and the need for future population. (JSON context reading might not be strictly needed but can be passed for consistency). (Prefer MCP `write_file_content`, fallback `write_to_file`).
        *   **If "Skip KB":**
            1.  No file creation delegation is needed for this step. The KB directory should already exist from **[Step 06](./06_create_dirs.md)**.

3.  **Await Completion:**
    *   Coordinator awaits the completion signal and status report from the Mode Structure Agent (if delegation occurred).

4.  **Proceed:** Upon successful completion (or if skipped), proceed to the next step: **[10_update_kb_readme.md](./10_update_kb_readme.md)**.

## Error Handling
*   If the Mode Structure Agent fails during KB file/directory creation (parsing JSON, creating subdirectories, writing files):
    *   Log the specific error(s).
    *   Notify the User about the failure.
    *   Ensure the KB README (to be created/updated in the next step) reflects the failure or incomplete state.
    *   Proceed with the workflow if possible, as the mode might function without a complete KB initially.
    *   Check the status of relevant MCP tools and fallback tools.

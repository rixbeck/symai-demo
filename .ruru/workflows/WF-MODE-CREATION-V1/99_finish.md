# Step 99: Workflow Finished

**Responsible Mode:** Coordinator (Roo Commander)

## Procedure

1.  **Confirm Preconditions:**
    *   Coordinator confirms that the user successfully verified the new mode's availability and basic functionality in **[Step 17](./17_finalization.md)**.

2.  **Mark Workflow Complete:**
    *   Coordinator logs the successful completion of the workflow.
    *   Coordinator uses `attempt_completion` to report the final success to the user/delegator.
        *   *Example Result:* "âœ… The Interactive New Mode Creation workflow (WF-MODE-CREATION-V1) completed successfully. The new mode '[Mode Title]' (`<new-slug>`) has been created, the registry updated, and temporary files cleaned up. The mode should be available for use."

## Postconditions
*   The workflow execution is terminated successfully.
*   All artifacts created during the workflow persist.

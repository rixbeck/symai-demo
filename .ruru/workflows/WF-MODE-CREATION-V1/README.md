# Workflow: Interactive New Mode Creation (.ruru/modes/ Structure)

## 1. Objective 🎯
To guide the creation of a new Roo Commander mode from scratch. This involves:
*   Gathering refined requirements and context preferences from the user upfront **using simplified options**.
*   Using the `.ruru/modes/` directory structure.
*   Applying predefined naming conventions (see `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/available-modes-summary.md`).
*   Generating a detailed "Core Knowledge & Capabilities" section within the mode definition file, preferring Vertex AI MCP tools.
*   Separating knowledge base (KB) content into the `kb/` subdirectory, with an interactive option to generate basic KB if source material is missing or insufficient, **applying the requested level of detail and potentially using subfolders**.
*   Creating mode-specific rules in the corresponding `.roo/rules-<slug>/` directory, **deferring standard rules**.
*   Generating an enhanced KB `README.md` file summarizing the KB contents.
*   Running the `.ruru/scripts/build_roomodes.js` script to update the application's mode registry.
*   Enforcing the use and structure of the standard mode template (`.ruru/templates/modes/00_standard_mode.md`).
*   Maximizing delegation of tasks to specialized agents where appropriate.
*   Using a temporary JSON file (`.ruru/temp/mode-creation-context-<new-slug>.json`) to pass synthesized context between steps.
*   Utilizing synthesis task templates from `.ruru/templates/synthesis-task-sets/` for structured context generation.
*   Preferring MCP tools (e.g., for file operations, research) with fallbacks to standard tools (`execute_command`, `write_to_file`, etc.).

## 2. Scope ↔️
This workflow applies when creating a *new* Roo Commander mode. Requires user interaction. Gathers detailed user input upfront (using simplified options for context preferences). Includes AI assessment of research depth. Creates structure in `.ruru/modes/` and `.roo/rules-<slug>/`. Uses naming conventions. Generates 'Core Knowledge' using Vertex AI MCP (if available) or fallback methods. Optionally populates KB files (potentially in subfolders) based on synthesized context (from JSON), applying requested detail level and AI assessment. Populates the standard mode template (from JSON). Generates KB README and KB lookup rule. Triggers mode registry update (`.ruru/scripts/build_roomodes.js`). Cleans up temporary JSON context file. Prefers MCP tools.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
*   **User:** Initiates the request, provides purpose/context, selects context preference option (or provides details), approves slug/classification/emoji, reviews KB options, potentially provides source files for Core Knowledge, and confirms final mode usability.
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Orchestrates the workflow, interacts with the User, delegates tasks to Worker Agents, performs QA, manages temporary context file, and manages finalization steps.
*   **Context Gatherer:** (Worker Agent, e.g., `agent-research`) Gathers relevant information based on the mode's purpose, scope, and user preferences from Step 1.5, **applying the selected detail level**.
*   **Context Synthesizer:** (Worker Agent, e.g., `agent-context-condenser`) Condenses gathered information into a structured JSON format based on synthesis task templates, suitable for mode definition and KB.
*   **Mode Structure Agent:** (Worker Agent, e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `technical-writer`, `toml-specialist`) Creates directories, reads/parses context from temporary JSON file, populates template files (mode definition, KB files, KB README, rules) based on context and templates, preferring MCP tools.
*   **QA Agent:** (Worker Agent, potentially Coordinator) Reviews generated artifacts against standards and requirements (part of ACQA process).

*   Existing Mode Examples: `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/available-modes-summary.md`
*   Standard Mode Template: `.ruru/templates/modes/00_standard_mode.md`
*   Standard Rule Template: `.ruru/templates/toml-md/16_ai_rule.md`
*   Synthesis Task Templates: `.ruru/templates/synthesis-task-sets/` (see `README.md` there)
*   TOML+MD Format Rule: `.ruru/rules/00-standard-toml-md-format.md`
*   QA Process: `.ruru/processes/acqa-process.md`

## 7. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
*   **Invalid Slug/Classification:** If agreement cannot be reached in Step 1, escalate to the User/owner for clarification or abandon the workflow.
*   **Context Gathering Failure (Step 2):** If agents fail (including reading user files or applying preference), retry. Check MCP tool status. If persistent, notify the User and potentially proceed with minimal context or abandon.
*   **AI Assessment Failure (Step 3):** If assessment fails, log the error, default rating to 'Standard', notify User, and proceed.
*   **Context Synthesis Failure (Step 4):** If agent fails to process context or use synthesis templates, retry. Check template validity. If persistent, notify User, consider manual synthesis or abandon.
*   **Context Saving Failure (Step 5):** If writing the temporary JSON file fails (both MCP and fallback), log the error, notify the user, and likely abandon the workflow as subsequent steps depend on it.
*   **Core Knowledge Generation Failure (Step 9):** If generation fails (MCP query, fallback synthesis, file insertion), log the error, notify the User. Ensure the `.mode.md` file reflects the failure (e.g., placeholder remains). Proceed if possible, but mode quality will be lower.
*   **KB Population Failure (Step 10):** If KB generation/population fails (including parsing JSON, creating subdirs, or file writing), notify the User, ensure the KB README reflects the failure, and proceed if possible (mode might function without KB initially). Check MCP/fallback tool status.
*   **File/Directory Operations Failure:** If the Mode Structure Agent fails critical operations (Step 7, 8, 10, 11, 12), retry. Log errors. Check MCP tool status and fallback execution. Persistent failure requires manual intervention or abandoning the workflow. Check if failure is related to reading/parsing the temporary JSON context file.
*   **QA Failures (Step 13):** Minor issues trigger corrections and re-QA. Repeated or significant failures (e.g., missing Core Knowledge) should trigger the Adaptive Failure Resolution (AFR) process (`.ruru/processes/afr-process.md`) to diagnose root causes.
*   **`.ruru/.ruru/scripts/build_roomodes.js` Failure (Step 15):** If the script fails, log the error output. Attempt to diagnose (e.g., syntax error in a mode file). If resolvable, fix and retry Step 15. If not, escalate the script error; the mode will not be available until resolved. **Ensure Step 16 (cleanup) is skipped or handled carefully if this step fails.**
*   **Temporary File Deletion Failure (Step 16):** If deletion fails (MCP and fallback), log the error. This is generally non-critical but should be noted. Manual cleanup might be required later.
*   **User Rejection (Step 14/18):** If the user rejects the final structure or cannot access the mode, gather detailed feedback. Attempt refinement loop (back to Step 14 or earlier). If fundamental issues persist, escalate or document the rejection and close.

## 8. PAL Validation Record 🧪
*(Process Assurance Lifecycle - defined in `.ruru/processes/pal-process.md`)*
*   **Date Validated:** (Needs validation for v1.0 directory format)
*   **Method:** (e.g., Walkthrough, Test Case Execution)
*   **Test Case(s):** (e.g., Create mode 'test-basic' with 'Standard KB' preference, Create mode 'dev-complex' with 'Deep Dive KB' preference and user files, Test 'Let me specify...' option in Step 00, Test AI Assessment (Step 02), Test KB Prompt options (Step 05), Test 'Comprehensive KB (Subfolders)' option (Steps 03, 09), Test context JSON file creation/read/parse/deletion, Test MCP tool preference/fallback for file ops, Test Core Knowledge generation via MCP, Test Core Knowledge generation via fallback (user files), Test Core Knowledge generation via fallback (base LLM))
*   **Findings/Refinements:** (Document results of validation here)

## 9. Revision History 📜
*   **v1.0 (2025-04-29):** Initial creation of directory-based workflow structure based on `WF-NEW-MODE-CREATION-004.md`. Steps split into individual files (00-17, 99).

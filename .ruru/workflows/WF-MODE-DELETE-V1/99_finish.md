# Step 99: Finish Mode Deletion

## Actions

(Coordinator `{{delegate_to}}` performs these actions)

1.  **Verify Previous Steps:** Check that `build_script_status` is "Success". If not, this step should ideally not be reached, but handle as an error if it is (**-> Error Step** defined in previous step).
2.  **Log Completion:** Log the successful deletion of mode `{{mode_slug}}` and the status of associated updates (`{{deletion_status}}`, `{{build_collections_update_status}}`). (Follow Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).
3.  **Prepare Final Report:** Construct the `workflow_result` output message confirming success.
    *   Example: "Successfully deleted mode `{{mode_slug}}`. Mode and rules directories removed. Build collections status: `{{build_collections_update_status}}`. Build script executed successfully to update configurations."
4.  **Report Outcome:** Use `attempt_completion` to report the `workflow_result` back to the User or initiating process.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The build script executed successfully in the previous step.
*   Successful completion is logged.
*   A final success message (`workflow_result`) is generated and reported.

## Error Handling

*   If the build script status was not "Success" (should be caught earlier), log an error.
*   Errors during final logging should be noted but may not prevent reporting overall success.

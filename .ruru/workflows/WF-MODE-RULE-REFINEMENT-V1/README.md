# Workflow: Mode Rule Refinement using AI Review

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To improve the accuracy, completeness, and clarity of operational mode rule files (`.roo/rules-mode-*/`) by leveraging AI analysis (specifically Vertex AI MCP) and incorporating the feedback through targeted updates.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   This workflow applies when existing rule files for an operational mode require review and potential refinement based on external documentation, best practices, or identified inconsistencies.
*   It focuses on using AI for analysis and `prime-dev` (or `prime-txt`) for applying changes.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **`prime-coordinator`:** Initiates the workflow, identifies target files, formulates queries for AI review, analyzes feedback, delegates file modifications, and oversees the process.
*   **`vertex-ai-mcp-server`:** Reads target files, performs AI-powered review based on the Coordinator's query, and saves the analysis.
*   **`prime-dev` (or `prime-txt`):** Applies specific changes to rule files as instructed by the Coordinator, following the Direct Auto-Apply workflow (including user confirmation).

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   The `vertex-ai-mcp-server` must be connected and available.
*   The target mode rule files (`.roo/rules-mode-*/...`) must exist.
*   The Coordinator must have context on the desired improvements or the source material for review (e.g., previous research file path).

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   Target rule files (`.roo/rules-mode-*/...`)
*   Source research/documentation (if applicable, e.g., previous Vertex AI output)
*   Vertex AI MCP Tools: `read_multiple_files_content`, `save_answer_query_websearch`
*   Prime Editor Tools: `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `apply_diff`
*   Coordination Tool: `new_task`
*   Relevant Rules:
    *   `.roo/rules-prime-coordinator/03-meta-dev-workflow-simplified.md` (Direct Auto-Apply)
    *   `.roo/rules/10-vertex-mcp-usage-guideline.md`

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Identify Target Files & Review Goal (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Coordinator identifies the specific rule files within a `.roo/rules-mode-*/` directory that need review and the goal of the review (e.g., check accuracy against specific documentation, suggest improvements for clarity).
    *   **Inputs:** User request or Coordinator's analysis.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` if necessary to confirm paths.
    *   **Outputs:** List of target file paths, clear review objective.

*   **Step 2: Read Files for Review (Coordinator delegates to `vertex-ai-mcp-server`)**
    *   **Description:** Read the content of all target rule files.
    *   **Tool:** `use_mcp_tool` (`vertex-ai-mcp-server`, `read_multiple_files_content`)
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** Array of target file paths.
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Combined content of the files.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for file content. Handle potential read errors.

*   **Step 3: Request AI Review (Coordinator delegates to `vertex-ai-mcp-server`)**
    *   **Description:** Ask Vertex AI to review the provided rule content based on the objective defined in Step 1.
    *   **Tool:** `use_mcp_tool` (`vertex-ai-mcp-server`, `save_answer_query_websearch`)
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   `query`: A detailed prompt including the review objective, the concatenated file content from Step 2, and instructions to check for accuracy, suggest improvements, and identify issues/ambiguities. Reference external documentation if applicable.
        *   `output_path`: A designated path in `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/` following naming conventions.
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of review saved to the specified file.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Handle potential MCP errors.

*   **Step 4: Analyze Review & Plan Updates (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Coordinator reads the AI-generated review and identifies specific, actionable changes for each rule file.
    *   **Inputs:** Path to the review file (from Step 3).
    *   **Procedure:** Use `read_file` to get review content. Analyze suggestions.
    *   **Outputs:** A plan detailing the exact changes (diffs or full content) needed for each target rule file.

*   **Step 5: Apply Updates Iteratively (Coordinator delegates to `prime-dev`)**
    *   **Description:** Apply the planned changes to each rule file one by one.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task` (targeting `prime-dev` or `prime-txt` as appropriate for file type).
    *   **Loop:** For each file needing changes:
        *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** Target file path, specific changes required (e.g., diff, replacement text, instructions for `prime-dev`). Reference the review document. Mention version increments if applicable.
        *   **Instructions for Delegate:** Instruct `prime-dev` to apply the changes using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`, emphasizing the need for user confirmation before writing (as per Direct Auto-Apply workflow).
        *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of successful update (after user approval).
        *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation for each file. Handle any errors reported by `prime-dev` or user denial. Log the update.
    *   **Error Handling:** If updates fail for a file, log the error and decide whether to retry, skip, or escalate.

*   **Step 6: Update Referencing Files (Optional) (Coordinator delegates to `prime-dev`)**
    *   **Description:** If the updated/new rules are referenced in other files (e.g., a main workflow rule's `related_context`), update those references.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task` (targeting `prime-dev` or `prime-txt`).
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** Path to the referencing file, specific changes needed (e.g., update version numbers, add new file paths to TOML list).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate:** Instruct `prime-dev` to apply changes using `apply_diff`, requiring user confirmation.
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of successful update.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Handle errors. Log the update.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   Target rule files (`.roo/rules-mode-*/...`) are updated with improvements based on AI review.
*   AI review document is saved in `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`.
*   (Optional) Referencing files are updated.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   Errors during MCP interaction should be reported to the user. Retry might be possible.
*   Errors during file modification by `prime-dev` (including user denial) should be reported. Coordinator may ask user for alternative action (skip, retry, manual edit).
*   Persistent or complex issues should be escalated for manual review.

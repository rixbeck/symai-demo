# Step 99: Finish Repomix Workflow

## Actions

1.  Aggregate inputs: `readme_path`, `context_copy_status`, `cleanup_status`.
2.  Determine overall success based on the success of previous critical steps (generation, README creation). Log any non-critical failures (e.g., cleanup, context copy).
3.  Generate the final `workflow_result` message, including success/failure status, the `readme_path`, `context_copy_status`, and `cleanup_status`.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Overall workflow success/failure is determined.
*   Final `workflow_result` output is generated for the coordinator.

## Error Handling

*   Report any errors encountered during aggregation or final reporting.

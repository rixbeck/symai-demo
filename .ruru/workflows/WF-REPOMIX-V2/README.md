# Workflow: Workflow: Repomix Standard Workflow V2

## Overview

Standard workflow for using the Repomix Specialist mode (spec-repomix)
to generate or update code based on repository context. This workflow guides
the process from defining the scope and context to generating, reviewing,
and applying the code changes.

## Usage

This workflow is typically initiated by a coordinator (like Roo Commander or Prime Coordinator) when a task requires context-aware code generation or modification using the Repomix Specialist. The coordinator provides the initial inputs, and the workflow steps guide the Repomix Specialist through the process.

## Inputs

*   **User Request:** Clear description of the desired outcome (e.g., "Generate a React component named 'UserProfile' based on the API spec").
*   **Target Path(s):** The file(s) or directory(ies) where the code should be generated or modified.
*   **Context Path(s):** The file(s) or directory(ies) that Repomix should use as context for generation.
*   **Specific Instructions (Optional):** Any additional constraints, style guides, or specific methods Repomix should follow.

## Outputs

*   **Code Artifacts:** The primary output is the newly generated or modified code file(s).
*   **Summary Report:** A confirmation message detailing the actions performed and listing the affected files.
*   **Diff/Patch (Optional):** A diff file might be generated for review before final application, depending on the specific step configuration.

# Step 99: Finish Workflow Creation

## Description

Finalizes the workflow creation process, reporting the path to the newly created workflow directory and its contents.

## Actions

1.  **Aggregate File Paths:** Collect the paths of the created workflow files from the inputs:
    *   `target_workflow_readme_path`
    *   `target_workflow_start_path`
    *   `target_workflow_step_paths` (list)
    *   `target_workflow_finish_path`
    *   `review_suggestions` (optional)
2.  **Construct Success Message:** Create a summary message confirming the successful creation of the workflow, listing the path to the new workflow directory (derived from the input paths), including any `review_suggestions` if present, and noting the `user_decision_on_suggestions` if available.
3.  **Prepare Output:** Set the `workflow_result` output variable with the success message (including suggestions).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   All input file paths (`target_workflow_readme_path`, `target_workflow_start_path`, `target_workflow_step_paths`, `target_workflow_finish_path`) are successfully received.
*   A success message is constructed, clearly indicating the path to the newly created workflow directory and including any review suggestions.
*   The `workflow_result` output contains the success message.

## Error Handling

*   If any input paths are missing or invalid, the step should fail, and an error message should be included in the `workflow_result`.

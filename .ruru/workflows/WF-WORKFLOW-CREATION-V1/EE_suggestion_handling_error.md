# Error Step: Suggestion Handling Failed

## Actions

1.  **Log Error:** Record the specific error details received from Step 06 (e.g., failure to present suggestions, error processing user decision).
2.  **Construct Error Message:** Create a user-friendly error message explaining the failure during suggestion handling. Assign this message to the `workflow_result` output variable.
3.  **Terminate Workflow:** Indicate that the workflow execution stops here due to the error.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The suggestion handling error details are logged.
*   An appropriate error message is generated in `workflow_result`.
*   The workflow terminates.

## Error Handling

*   This is an error handling step. Log any unexpected issues encountered during this step.
